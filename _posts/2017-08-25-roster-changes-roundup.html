<p>There has been a lot of roster movement in professional Counter-Strike scene in the past ten days both worldwide and in the Oceania region with new teams being formed, old teams being dropped and players switching teams.</p>

{% include logoheadline.html logo="grayhound" headline="Grayhound Gaming sign the former Immunity team" %} 

<p>Grayhound Gaming are a new organisation in Australia created in Match. With regards to the new organisation, team member Sean “Gratisfaction” Kaiwai spoke to HLTV.org:</p>

{% include quote.html text="Stepping forward towards the future, I can unequivocally say that we’re all extremely happy being able to call ‘Grayhound Gaming’ our new home. We’re certain Grayhound will carry forth a new standard for how every Australian organisation will operate and we’re proud to be a part of that." %}

{% include logoheadline.html logo="ence" headline="ENCE release their entire Counter-Strike squad" %} 

<p>ENCE had already parted ways with their old team in 2016, but looked to make a fresh start with the SkitLite lineup in February of this year. The new team has failed to make any sort of impact with constantly bad results both online and offline – the only LAN event the squad attended was Lantrek 2017 and they came in 9th-12th after failing to make it out of the group stages. Management Assistant aNGeldusT had this to say:</p>

{% include quote.html text="After trying out numerous alternatives, the team and organisation felt that the situation wasn’t providing the right results and thus we decided to part ways. ENCE still strives for Professional eSports in the Nordics, and we will continue to spearhead that movement in the future. Rather than counting out CSGO, we are re-focusing our efforts to find the best match for our organization and a benchmark for Finnish CS, the way it’s meant to be." %} 

{% include logoheadline.html logo="taintedminds" headline="'liazz' and 'dexter' step down from Tainted Minds" %} 

<p>Tainted Minds are a Counter-Strike team that on paper looks good, but have not been performing at all online or in qualifiers and this has lead to them losing two of their players. Christopher ‘dexter’ Nong used a TwitLonger to explain that he is leaving the professional scene for now and “will be re-evaluating his options”, Jay ‘liazz’ Tregillgas has different plans and has been released from his contract to seek a new team.</p>

{% include logoheadline.html logo="ldlc" headline="'DEVIL' has returned to the Team LDLC lineup" %} 

<p>In the biggest roster news this week Team LDLC announced that they have resigned ‘DEVIL’ and that he will be replacing ‘mistou’, who will move to a substitute spot. Captain Kévin ‘Ex6TenZ‘ Droolans had this to say:</p>

{% include quote.html text="Our goals are very ambitious and recent results have sometimes been disappointing, although we have done great performances in EPL and haven’t been ridiculous at the Minor. But not to mention results, we felt we needed a change to allow us to go one step further. Mistou gave a lot to the team and he allowed us to move forward and we can thank him for that, but he missed a little something… I hope he finds it in the future! Now the road continues with Devil. It’s a player who showed a lot of strength, I hope we will do a good job together to allow him to explode. Here we go again!" %}

<p>The last roster move this week was an obvious one, since ‘powerputte’ had already been playing a couple of matches with his new team, but still an exciting prospect for the team. Patrik “powerputte” Perjons released an official statement on Rogue’s FaceBook page about joining the team:</p>

{% include quote.html text="I’ve been practicing with the team for about 2 weeks now and we’re currently in Berlin at CaseKing for a 2 week boot camp ahead of the NeSA LAN in Finland and some Dreamhack qualifiers. So far I’ve been treated well and it feels really good in the team. Everyone are good friends so I think with good chemistry, good results will come after some time." %}
