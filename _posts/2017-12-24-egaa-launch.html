<p>Today we announce the formulation of EGAA - Esports Games Association of Australia and New Zealand, a unifying peak body for the esports industry.</p>

<p>The Esports Games Association (EGAA) is dedicated to growing and further legitimising esports in Australia and New Zealand. As one of its first initiatives, the newly formed EGAA  is organising an esports conference, then acting in an official partner capacity to help support MCV Pacific with the Esports Pro Oceania Awards night on March 14th, 2018.</p>

<p>EGAA, working with players, teams, managers, organisers and sponsors, aims to set and improve the structures and standards for the whole industry and help advance the Australian esports scene. The vision of EGAA is for a unified, supportive scene that nurtures stability, growth and fairplay for esports in ANZ.</p>

<p>Among its initial services the EGAA will provide members with access to an industry conference, facilitate communication, networking, professional development and education, provide an avenue for engagement in esports for members with government and business, assistance in league and organisation structure and more.</p>

<p>The founding board of the EGAA is composed of highly experienced and engaged members of the esports industry in ANZ, whose backgrounds and skillsets represent the varied roles and pathways in the space.  A deep knowledge and passion for esports is matched by a shared vision to support opportunities and growth through this inclusive organisation.</p>
