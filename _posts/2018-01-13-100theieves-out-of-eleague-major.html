<p>100 Thieves just announced on their Twitter that due to visa issues their team cannot compete in Boston for the ELEAGUE Counter-Strike major in the following weeks. ELEAGUE have released a statement about the empty slot left in the tournament.</p>

<p>The official twitter account tweeted out surprisingly about their status in the major:</p>

{% include quote.html text="We are disappointed to share that due to immigration issues, the 100 Thieves CS:GO team will not be attending the upcoming Boston major. It goes without saying that this is devastating for the players and for us. We are truly sorry for them and their fans." %} 

<p>The account then followed up by elaborating on what went wrong:</p>

{% include quote.html text="We worked incredibly hard with industry-leading immigration lawyers since the day we signed the players to get them here with plenty of time to spare. Unfortunately, things donâ€™t always go according to plan. That being said, we can't wait to see these guys compete this year." %} 

<p>This leaves a spare slot in the "New Champions Stage" of the major, but ELEAGUE have come up with a solution with Valve to replaces the spot with someone from the "New Legends Stage":</p>

{% include quote.html text="We will identify a replacement through the use of decider matches, formatted in collaboration with Valve, that will include the team(s) finishing The New Challenger stage with a 2-3 record who also faced the strongest performing opponents. The team to perform the best in the decider match(es) will replace 100Thieves in The New Legends stage set to begin Friday, Jan. 19, at 10 a.m. ET on Twitch." %}

<p>We can confirm that 100 Thieves have already been removed by Valve in the Boston 2018 sticker buying interface, much like TyLoo after their visa issues. TyLoo's previous visa issues saw them miss out on a spot in "The New Challengers Stage" after coming second in the Asia Minor, they were replaced by and new stickers created for Flash Gaming who came in third in the Asia Minor.</p>
