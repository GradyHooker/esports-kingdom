<p>SK Gaming's coldzera, the number one Counter-Strike: Global Offensive player for the second year in the row, sat down and did an AMA on r/GlobalOffensive and answered various questions between practicing for the ELEAGUE Boston 2018 Major.</p>

<p>For the full AMA posted on r/SquaredCircle, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/7r7dou/coldzera_ama/">visit the thread</a>. Note that answers have been altered slightly to fix typos and improve readability.</p>

<p class="interview-question">u/officialcadiaN: How much does fer communicate when doing his aggressive moves, can imagine that it could be quite hectic for him when being behind enemy lines.</p>
<p>coldzera: Most of his aggression we practice the situation in practice, and the outcomes that should have after, when he dies, or when he kills, he really calm to communicate and the info from him always comes "clean". The funny thing is, sometimes he says "I'm dead, I'm dead" and all of a sudden he kills 3 people lol</p>

<p class="interview-question">u/Fake_itani: Whats your Favourite CS moment in your career?</p>
<p>The "the jumping double from cold"</p>

<p class="interview-question">u/rmakura: At what point in your CS:GO career, did you have that feeling of "Damn, I think I might be one of the best at this"?</p>
<p>The first bootcamp outside Brazil. I remember I was like "I'm playing against guys that I used to watch, we scrimmed with NaVi, I've dropped in that scrim like 50 bombs and I thought "they are good, but I'm good too". I remember FalleN saying to me "cold everybody is asking where I found you" lol.</p>

<p class="interview-question">u/versonjohn: How would you describe your own role on SK? What are you supposed to do during the beginning, middle and end of the round?</p>
<p>I would describe my role as a support player, and a closer, thanks to my teammates they always put me in good positions and great info to close the round.</p>

<p class="interview-question">u/UndercoverLab: What's your favorite food to eat when you are in America?</p>
<p>We go a lot to cheesecake factory lol</p>

<p class="interview-question">u/Aphix_: Has the main SK core ever had problems in terms of disagreements or arguments? If so, how did you overcome them?</p>
<p>I think being away from home helped a lot to made a bond together, and of course we had fights like every team, don't forget we live almost 320 days+ together!! I think due our friendship we overcome a lot of problems! We feel like a family, it's been almost 3 years together, traveling, eating etc, everything together, so its normal to have arguments.</p>

<p class="interview-question">u/kukay29: Your thoughts about the recent major qualifier? Any thoughts on any upsets?</p>
<p>For me the best team in the qualifier was Cloud9!! Dunno about upsets, lets wait and see, every team in the major, are capable to pull a good fight! Don't forget, this tournaments is just for the best teams in the world.</p>

<p class="interview-question">u/cJaayGaming: What is the IGL/calling dynamic within your team?</p>
<p>Everybody is free to call, and help FalleN. Our job is to make his job easier feeding him with info.</p>

<p class="interview-question">u/hsarinCSGO: Tips on improving, and breaking into the international scene from a weak cs country like Australia?</p>
<p>I think nowadays almost every place has a chance to go to international LAN. Don't give up and qualify, when we moved to NA I remember the guys were legends already, and we never got invited for any tournament despite being legends already, the would practice one map the whole week just to play on EPL, and sometimes get DDOS...never give up!</p>

<p class="interview-question">u/Absolute010: Marcelo, are you a cyborg?</p>
<p>Nope, I ticked the captcha thing before doing the AMA kkkkkkkkkkkkkkk</p>
