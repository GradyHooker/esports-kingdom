<p>Ghost Gaming stepped into the world of PUBG in September, picking up four young talents. The squad was first tested at Intel Extreme Masters Oakland 2017 where they were able to capture third place, narrowly missing out on second by 10 points, Ghost showed they were a force to be reckoned with.</p>
