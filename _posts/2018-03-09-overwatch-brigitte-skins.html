<p>Back on the last day in February Blizzard graced us with the announcement of a brand new hero called Brigitte. She is a support class character that can heal, provide armor and do damage to multiple opponents at once with her Rocket Flail. Lets look at her skins!</p>

<p>Brigitte is available to play on the Public Test Realm and as such people have found all of her skins. There was the usual recolours, but also some skins; based on her father Torbjörn (Ironclad), based on her godfather Reinhardt (Máni) and white/gold armored paladin (Sól).</p>
