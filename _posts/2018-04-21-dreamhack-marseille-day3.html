<p>Day 3 is done and dusted at Le DÃ´me de Marseille, and it was as entertaining as it was depressing for some. I went 2-2 on the day, for a record of 4-2 over Day 2 and 3.</p>

<p class="subheading">Group A</p>
{% include team-info.html logo="envyus" logo2="faze" text="Map 1 was EnVy's choice of train with FaZe on the T side to start. EnVy took the pistol round and 4 of the first 5 rounds to jump to a surprising 4-1 lead over the European super team. FaZe was not rattled though, and quickly won 4 of the next 5 to tie it at 5 all. EnVy then went on a 3 round streak before FaZe took the final two rounds of the half to go into the second half with EnVy having the surprising lead at 8-7. EnVy again took the pistol round in the second half, and that translated into four more rounds after. EnVy took a tremendous 13-7 lead, but they couldn't close it out, as FaZe proceeded to completely swing momentum in their own favor. They went on to win all but one of the final 10 rounds, winning the first map in a close 16-14 score. The MVP of the map goes to hAdji, without whom, EnVy may have not jumped out to the lead they had, as he finished with a 32/4/19 stat line and a 1.55 rating." %}

<p>FaZe choose Overpass for map 2, with EnVy choosing CT first, but this game was not to be like the last. FaZe quickly showed by they were the favorites, winning the pistol and the first 5 rounds. EnVy only managed to take 3 rounds in the first half, and unfortunately for French fans, that was all they would get the rest of the game. FaZe took the second half pistol and then won out, finishing with a stomp of a 16-3 score. The MVP here was hard to choose as the entire FaZe team was better than the entire EnVy team. But, I had to ultimately give it to karrigan for his 20/6/8 and 105.6 ADR with an outstanding 1.88 rating.</p>

<p>This was not a surprising result, as FaZe destroyed EnVy in the first match of the tournament. EnVy put up a bit more of a fight than expected in the first map, but ultimately they couldn't manage much more than that.</p>

{% include team-info.html logo="mousesports" logo2="skgaming" text="SK decided to go with Cache as their map pick and mouse happily took T side. It looked good for SK to start, as they picked up the pistol round, but mouse took the eco round with a stunning 3k from ropz with a deagle. This completely swung momentum in their favor and they won all but the final round of the half, closing out an ugly 13-2 lead going into the second half. In the second half, mouse took the pistol and the next round to put them on match point early, but SK fought back, winning the next 8 rounds to close the gap to 15-10. That was all they could muster however as mousesports brought out the deagles again on an eco and managed to take a couple ak's to win the final round. The MVP of this game was most definitely ropz. Though he didn't even have the highest kill count or rating on his team, he had several crucial kills throughout the match that swung momentum in mouse's favor and kept it there. He finished with an 18/4/15 stat line and a 1.23 rating." %}

<p>Mirage was mouse's map pick and SK picking T side. Unfortunately for the Brazilians, this game went much like the first. mouse took the first 5 rounds and 13 in the first half. SK was never allowed to get into a rhythm. In the second half, mouse took the pistol round, but then traded the next two rounds back and forth. mouse once again showed a scary inability to close a game out quickly, allowing SK to take the first three match point chances they had before closing the game out 16-6. MVP of the game again goes to ropz, this time for the tremendous stat line of 26/3/8, 115.4 ADR and a 1.83 rating.</p>

<p>Alright mousesports fans....I'm eating my crow now. mouse completely defied my expectations by not only making it competitive, but completely dismantling an SK squad that looked lost the entire match.</p>

{% include team-info.html logo="fnatic" logo2="renegades" text="On Renegades map pick of Mirage, Fnatic took CT side, and Renegades took the first 3 rounds. Then Fnatic seemed to come alive, dominating the rest of the half, only giving up the final two rounds to take a 10-5 lead into the second half. Fnatic used their first half momentum to take the second pistol round and the next 3 rounds, giving them a 14-5 lead. Renegades then showed why they are in the tournament, and came back to give Fnatic a run. Renegades took the next 7 rounds cutting Fnatic's lead down to 2, 14-12. That was as close as it would get though, as Fnatic won 2 of the next 3 to close the game 16-13. MVP goes to KRIMZ for dropping 33 kills, 106.4 ADR and a 1.44 rating." %}

<p>Fnatic's map choice was Cobblestone, but at first, it didn't look like they were the ones who picked it. Renegades, on the CT side, took the first 5 rounds. Fnatic again, off to a slow start, finally turned it around, winning 9 of the final 10 rounds of the half. In the second half, Fnatic took the pistol and only allowed Renegades 2 more rounds, winning 16-8. Unsurprisingly KRIMZ gets the MVP again for a great 1.68 rating and some key kills to turn the game around.</p>

<p>Fnatic did what was expected of them, and Renegades performed admirably in game 1. Unfortunately for the American side, they were just completely outclassed.</p>

{% include team-info.html logo="liquid" logo2="gambit" text="Overpass was again picked by Liquid's opponent, Gambit, with Liquid starting on the CT side. This time however, Liquid did not allow it to get away quickly. They took the pistol round and 9 of the first 11. However, Gambit bounced back and won out the half to go into the second half only down 9-6. The second half started much like the first, with Liquid taking the pistol round and 6 of the first 7. This put them on match point, but, Liquid continued their inability to close matches and Gambit won the next 5 rounds before Liquid was finally able to win the match 16-12. MVP of the map goes to TACO with a solid 24/3/16 and a 1.41 rating." %}

<p>Map 2 was Mirage as picked by Liquid. Gambit started strong on CT side with a pistol round win and the 8 of the first 9 rounds. Liquid, like Gambit in game 1, bounced back to win 5 of the last 6, taking the map to half 9-6 in favor of Gambit. The second half started promising for Liquid with a pistol round win, but that was about all they got. Gambit won the eco round and 7 of the final 8 to take the map 16-8. MVP easily goes to AdreN as he had some very important kills, including a 3k to end the map. He had a stat line of 22/6/14 and a 1.48 rating.</p>

<p>The decider map was Train. Gambit started on CT side and won the pistol, but Liquid won the proceeding eco and took 4 consecutive rounds to lead 4-1. Gambit didn't let the match get out of control though, and proceeded to win 8 of the final 10 rounds to take yet another 6-9 halftime lead. The second half started with Gambit winning four in a row, but they let Liquid fight back. Liquid proceeded to win 7 of the next 8 rounds and close the gap to a 1 round lead for Gambit. Unfortunately for the NA side that was as close as they got, and Liquid bowed out of the tournament after a disappointing 16-14 loss. MVP again goes to AdreN with key kills and a 30/4/21 stat line, 107 ADR, and a 1.52 rating.</p>

<p>Gambit performed way better than I expected. Liquid did just the opposite. Congratulations to Gambit for finding a way to beat the team that handled them in the first set of matches on Day 1.</p>

{% include team-info.html logo="navi" logo2="mousesports" text="Na'Vi has relied far too heavily on s1mple for far too long. Something has to break. After mouse handily beat SK, I think that they are the team to break NaVi this match. NaVi is still NaVi, so they take a map, but mouse goes through in 3." %}

{% include team-info.html logo="cloud9" logo2="gambit" text="I disrespected Gambit once already, and while I don't want to do it again, Cloud9 is still the returning Major champs and swept FaZe on Day 2. Gambit might take a game off of them, but I still think Cloud9 is playing too well for Gambit. C9 in a sweep." %}

{% include team-info.html logo="astralis" logo2="faze" text="Astralis is on absolute fire right now, and FaZe, for as good as they are, can't seem to put it all together at the same time. For that reason, I'm going to give this one to Astralis in 3." %}

{% include team-info.html logo="nip" logo2="fnatic" text="A matchup many wanted, but that they wanted later on in the playoffs. This pits two teams playing very good CS at LAN. I think it is honestly a toss up, but I am going to go with NiP in 3, if only because they have been playing mistake-free CS." %}
