<p>After a month of splatting at the highest level across Australia and New Zealand, the two Splatoon 2 top-ranked teams came together for the 2018 AUNZ Splatoon 2 Cup’s grand finale in Melbourne this past weekend. After a thrilling grand final at Supanova Melbourne, it was team Yeah Nah who came out on top with a 5-0 victory.</p>

<p>Not only did both teams leave with special jerseys and gleaming trophies, but team Yeah Nah has now earned the title of Splatoon Australian and New Zealand Champions and will represent Australia and New Zealand on the biggest stage of all, at the Splatoon 2 World Championship from 11th – 12th June in Los Angeles. They’ll be up against the top teams from the U.S. and Canada, Europe, and Japan – can they emerge victorious on the world stage?</p>

<p>To see how team Yeah Nah secured their ticket to Los Angeles, you can watch the 2018 AUNZ Splatoon 2 Cup enthralling final on the <a hred="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/252699547">ESL Australia Twitch channel<a/>. Although both teams managed to impress throughout the tournament, it was team Yeah Nah that stole the show with a 5-0 victory against ScarthAce in the final that included some very close results, with the first game decided by 0.2%.</p>

<p>Team Yeah Nah may have taken the win, but two-time grand finalists ScarthAce were worthy contenders, showing masterful skill and great sportsmanship. Qualifying on top in the second round of 2018 online qualifiers, ScarthAce are no strangers to the big stage, having achieved runner-up in last year’s 2017 AUNZ Splatoon Cup. We thank ScarthAce for their continued perseverance, dedication and inspiration they provide to everybody in the Splatoon community.</p>
