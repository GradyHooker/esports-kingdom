<p>The Grand Finals are over at Dreamhack Masters Marseilles in Le DÃ´me de Marseilles. Congratulations to Astralis on not only winning the Grand Finals, but taking NaVi to the woodshed. They look well poised for the next couple upcoming LAN's.</p>

<p class="subheading">Semifinal #1</p>
{% include team-info.html logo="navi" logo2="gambit" text="The first map of Semifinal 1 was Gambit's choice of Nuke. NaVi started on CT, and never let Gambit into the first half. NaVi took the pistol round, and only gave Gambit 2 rounds in the first half to take a devastating 13-2 lead into the half. In the second half Gambit showed a little bit of life, winning the first five rounds, but NaVi just would not allow it to continue. They won out the next 3 rounds to easily finish the match at 16-7 in an absolute stomp. The MVP was hard to decide, as every member of NaVi played well, but it goes to electronic. He put out an absurd 125.9 ADR and a 1.90 rating, far better than S1mple's 112 ADR and 1.79 rating." %}

<p>Train was the pick for NaVI, as Gambit again started on T side. Gambit managed to take the first pistol round and the first 3 rounds, but NaVi quickly answered with 3 of their own. Gambit turned it back in their favor with another trio of rounds, but NaVi decided to shut down this back and forth by winning the final 6 rounds of the half. NaVi went into the second half with a 9-6 lead. Gambit took the pistol round in the second half again, but could only turn it into two rounds before NaVi again took 3 more rounds. Gambit was able to close the gap with 4 round wins, but that 12-12 tied score was all they would manage. NaVi won out to take the game and the match 16-12. MVP easily goes to the stalwart s1mple. He had a 28/3/15 stat line, 94 ADR, and a great 1.62 rating.</p>

<p>NaVi never really looked weak in this match. Despite what Gambit fans may have wanted in ridiculing me for picking NaVi yesterday, they just could not realistically compete with NaVi, as not a single Gambit player had a better rating than any NaVi player in either game. The second game's score does not note how ugly it actually was. NaVi moves onto the Grand Final and in stunning form as a team.</p>

<p class="subheading">Semifinal #2</p>
{% include team-info.html logo="astralis" logo2="fnatic" text="Game 1 was Astralis' pick and they went with Overpass. Fnatic started on T side, and it started well for them. They won the first two rounds, but that was almost all they managed in the first half. Astralis won the next 7 rounds, then gave up a single round to Fnatic before winning out the final 5 rounds of the half. They took an emphatic 12-3 lead into the second half. Fnatic kept their cool though, and won the first two rounds of the second half. Unfortunately for the Swedes that was all they would win. Astralis won the final 4 rounds to crush Fnatic's hopes and dreams 16-5. MVP was a no-contest in device's favor. He went 28/3/8, with 120.4 ADR and an ungodly 2.16 rating." %}

<p>Game 2 was on Mirage, Fnatic's pick, and Astralis started on T side this time. Fnatic won the pistol round, but lost the eco. The two sides then traded the next 6 rounds back and forth until Fnatic was able to lock down the first half. Fnatic won 6 of the final 7 rounds to take a commanding 10-5 lead into the second half. Astralis did not panic though, and won the first two rounds of the second half. Fnatic responded with a pair of their own to make the score 12-7. Then Astralis suddenly flipped a switch. They won the next five rounds to tie the game, then never slowed down, winning out the final 4 rounds to take the game and match 16-12 in emphatic fashion. MVP goes to Xyp9x for his amazing holds, key kills, and important clutches over the course of the second half of the game. He posted a 23/6/13 line, 74.2 ADR and a very respectable 1.24 rating.</p>

<p>This wasn't pretty, nor was it really as close as the game two score may try to show. Fnatic really stood little to no chance in this one with the form that Astralis was in. Fnatic had a good run in the first half of game 2, but they could not swing momentum back in their favor once Astralis took it, and that looks to be important for the Danes moving forward.</p>

<p class="subheading">Grand Final</p>
{% include team-info.html logo="navi" logo2="astralis" text="Astralis had the first map pick of the Grand Finals, and with it they chose Nuke. NaVi started on T side, but never really got it going in this game. Astralis took the first pistol round and the following 3 rounds before NaVi got their feet under themselves. NaVi won 2 of the next three, but that was all Astralis would let them have. Astralis won the final 7 rounds of the half in brutal fashion to end the half up 13-2. In the second half Astralis again won the pistol round. This time though, NaVi managed to steal the eco round. Unfortunately they couldn't translate that into momentum as they traded the next 3 rounds back and forth until Astralis closed the game 16-4. Xyp9x only died 6 times en route to a 16/6/6 line, 99 ADR, and a 1.66 rating and my MVP of the game" %}

<p>NaVi's choice was Inferno for Game 2, and Astralis took T side. Though they got the bomb plant down, NaVi won the pistol round and eco. Astralis took round 3, but NaVi took back the initiative with the next two rounds. Astralis however looked like they did in game 1 by winning the next 8 rounds before NaVi managed to swing the final two rounds of the half. At half, Astralis led 9-6. In the second half it looked like NaVi had stepped up to the challenge, tying it at 9 after winning the first three rounds, unfortunately it was not meant to be. Astralis rebounded and won the next 4 rounds. Though NaVi managed to pull 2 more rounds in the last 5, Astralis closed the game out 16-11. The MVP was so close, and such a hard choice, that I actually had to give my first co-MVP of the tournament. Device and gla1ve share the MVP. Device had 21/6/17 line, 81.7 ADR and a 1.22 rating. Gla1ve brought 22/7/16 line 87.4 ADR, and a 1.22 rating.</p>

<p>Astralis looked unstoppable throughout much of the tournament and was by far the most in-form team. They had the best team play, and yet I still doubted them, if only because NaVi has the freakish talent of s1mple. Unfortunately for NaVi, they couldn't back s1mple up in game 1, despite his 1.48 rating. Then in game 2, he only managed a 1.19 rating, and NaVi has only won 12 games in the last 12 months when s1mple get below a 1.20 rating.</p>
