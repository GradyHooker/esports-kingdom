<p>ESL have announced that the previous active duty map pool change of removing Cobblestone and adding Dust2 will take place before two major upcoming tournaments hosted by them. The first game of which is scheduled to be played in less than a week.</p>

<p>ESL tweeted out the news this morning:</p>
{% include quote.html text="Dust2 will be used instead of Cobblestone in ESL events starting with #IEM Sydney and #ESLProLeague Finals in Dallas." %} 

<p>Dust2 has been absent from the active duty pool since February 3, 2017 when Valve replaced it with the newly refreshed Inferno map. On October 18, 2017 a new and updated version of the map was released to the public including a graphical refresh, but without many functional differences. The big change was four days ago when <a href="http://blog.counter-strike.net/index.php/2018/04/20344/">Valve announced</a> that Dust2 would be returning to the Active Duty map pool after more than a year out of play in professional tournaments, bumping Cobblestone.</p>

<p>IEM Sydney is the first major tournament to feature the map pool change, but not all players are happy. From what we can understand the decision to play Dust2 instead of Cobblestone came down to a player-vote, from Fnatic JW's tweet here:</p>
{% include quote.html text="I understand if teams with cbble as perma ban voted for dust2 to be played in Sydney. But i expect ESL to understand that none of the teams will actually be ready on it. If two teams decide to play it, its just cus they dont care about the tourney as much as they should." %} 

<p>But it is not all doom and gloom for JW, in fact he promises that we will see Dust2 at Sydney:</p>
{% include quote.html text="On a sidenote i am really happy to see something happening in the scene and i am looking forward to play a ‚Äùnew‚Äù map again. This just wasnt the right tournament to have it the first time. But you guys know JW, i will make sure we play it in Sydney ü§™ü§™" %} 

<p>What this means for each individual team's map pool is yet to be seen, but any team who has previously perma-banned Cobblestone will be getting a new ban and everyone will start to shift. If I had to guess, I would say that no team will pick Dust2, but that it may fall through the cracks as the decider in best-of-threes and will probably feature in the grand finals at IEM Sydney.</p>

<p>In some more positive news, it appears as though Valve is also improving with their communication towards tournament organizers and actually warned them of the upcoming update before it landed, or at least the Director of DreamHack Masters says so, and they were running the Dreamhack Masters Marseille event at the time of the update:</p>
{% include quote.html text="We will naturally continue with the old pool for the remainder of the tournament, thus cobblestone is still in. [...] Lastly, we did get a heads up from Valve last night about the update. Much appreciated!" %}
