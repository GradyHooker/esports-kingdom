<p>This morning as well as <a href='../counter-strike/2018-04-faceit-london-major-tickets'>ticket details</a> FACEIT also revealed the qualifier details and structure to get yourself into the SSE Arena in Wembley and compete with the world's best Counter-Strike teams.</p>

<p class="subheading">Europe</p>

<p>The Europe Region will have 4 Open Qualifiers (2 June, 4 June, 11 June and 16 June) with the top two teams from each of the qualifiers making their way into the Europe Closed Qualifier.</p>

<p>The teams attending the Europe Closed Qualifier (29 June - 1 July) will be the 8 qualified teams from the Europe Open Qualifiers as well as 8 yet-unknown invited teams. All of the games will be Best of 3 and played in a 16-team Swiss Format. The top 8 teams from the Europe Closed Qualifier are then advanced into the Europe Minor.</p>

<p class="subheading">CIS</p>

<p>Like the Europe Region, the CIS Region is fairly straight-forward. There will be 4 Open Qualifiers (14 May, 18 May, 21 May and 25 May) and the top two teams from each of the qualifiers will slide right into the CIS Closed Qualifier.</p>

<p>The CIS Closed Qualifier will be played from 1 July - 3 July and feature those eight teams with the CIS Open Qualifiers as well as eight more invited teams, to be announced later. The sixteen teams play off in a Swiss Format mini-tournament with the Bottom 8 going home and the Top 8 moving on the CIS Minor.</p>

<p class="subheading">Americas</p>

<p>The Americas Region has two different paths depending if you are form North America or South America.</p>

<p>For South America, there will be two Open Qualifiers (19 May and 26 May) and winning either of these nets you an instant spot in the Americas Minor, without going through a Closed Qualifier.</p>

<p>For North America, there is once again four Open Qualifiers (2 June, 4 June, 11 June and 16 June) and the top two teams from each will find a spot in the North America Closed Qualifier (22 June - 24 June). These eight teams will face eight invited teams will once again play a Bo3 Swiss Format to determine the top teams, but only 6 will advance to meet the South American teams at the Americas Minor.</p>

<p class="subheading">Asia</p>

<p>The Asia Region has the most separate qualifiers to get to the minor, the Asia Minor is also the only Minor to feature invited teams. The full make-up of the Asia Minor is as follows:</p>

<li>2x Invited Teams</li>

<li>East Asia Open Qualifier (18 May)</li>

<li>Middle East + South Asia Open Qualifier (18 May)</li>

<li>China Open Qualifier (18 May)</li>

<li>Oceania Open Qualifier (25 May)</li>

<li>2x India + SEA Open Qualifier (25 May)</li>

<p class="subheading">The Minors</p>

<p>All four of the Minors will be played with two double elimination groups (GSL), the initial round match-ups will be Best of 1, but the deciders will be played as Best of 3. The top two teams from each of the groups will then advance into the play-offs to determine the top two of the region.</p>
