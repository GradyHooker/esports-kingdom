<p>IEM Sydney is kicking off today in the ESL Studios with Group A and Group B playing their initial BO1 matches as well as Group A's second round BO3 games in the upper and lower brackets.</p>

<p class="subheading">Group A</p>

{% include team-info.html logo="faze" logo2="order" text="We have seen this match-up before at IEM Katowice and ORDER has been unlucky to get it again in the first round. Last time the game went 16-3 to FaZe and I expect that this time it follows pretty similar (as much as I want ORDER to upset)." %}

{% include team-info.html logo="legacy" logo2="renegades" text="Both teams have the home-country advantage and want to make it to the big stage in Sydney. Renegades missed out last year, but this year they should come out of the gates with an easy win over Legacy, who were a last minute addition following Space Soldier's visa problems and are going to be missing star player 'yellow'." %}

{% include team-info.html logo="cloud9" logo2="grayhound" text="It is always exciting to see Grayhound playing and this time it is on a big stage trying to beat the current reigning major champions. Although Grayhound is coming off placing top in the LPL Alpha Invitational and squashing Tainted Minds 2-0 in the final, the blues in boy are a completely different monster. I have to predict a Cloud9 win here as they are still firing hot enough form the major win to beat a local team." %}

{% include team-info.html logo="tyloo" logo2="skgaming" text="I am having flashbacks...but there is no way TyLoo can beat SK Gaming here...or is there? SK are coming off a fresh roster change by taking 'Stewie2K' from Cloud9 and losing long-time teammate TACO, but they seem to be able to perform well enough in the online matches to at least beat TyLoo...hopefully." %}

<p class="subheading">Group B</p>

{% include team-info.html logo="mousesports" logo2="boot" text="I have seen very little from B.O.O.T-dream[S]cape, but they have a tough first round matchup going up against international side mousesports who are also on a hot-streak as of late. This looks like on paper that it will be another stomping of a oceanic/asian team in the first round." %}

{% include team-info.html logo="nrg" logo2="astralis" text="The best matchup of the opening rounds right here. NRG have been absolutely insane online and it will be interesting to see if they can keep this form on LAN against some of the worlds best. On the other side of the coin Astralis have also been dominant as of late and took out everyone to walk out with the DreamHack Masters Marseille trophy last month. I'll take Astralis, but wouldn't be surprised if NRG upset." %}

{% include team-info.html logo="g2" logo2="mvp" text="Although G2 Esports was a last minute addition to the Sydney tournament, due to Natus Vincere's visa troubles, they still have the leg up on the Korean side. You can't count out MVP though, they did top the Asian Qualifier for this tournament and G2 are having roster issues, but I still don't think MVP are on G2's level." %}

{% include team-info.html logo="chiefs" logo2="fnatic" text="Last year at this very tournament Chiefs had a miracle run defeating both North and Renegades in the group stages, but were still unable to make the stage, this year they want to get there. Standing in their way is a 7 foot tall Swedish side that isn't going to let that happen. Fnatic should be able to beat Chiefs easy, but that is what I said about North last year." %}
