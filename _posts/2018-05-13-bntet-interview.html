<p>Fresh off defeating teams like SK Gaming and Cloud9 in the IEM Sydney group stages we talk to star player of the Chinese team TyLoo, BnTeT, about his team, their performance and the Asian scene as a whole.</p>

{% include video.html video="_Yx1RwqzEHA" caption="Video of Interview with TyLoo's BnTeT at IEM Sydney" %}

<p class="interview-question">Grady: You guys haven't been performing that well as of late, but then you come into IEM Sydney and you haven't dropped a map and your into the semifinals - is there something that has changed in the team?</p>
<p>BnTeT: Nothing really changed, we just feel there is nothing to lose and feel really confident and I think all people know the Chinese guys they are not afraid whoever their opponent was, they just feel confident and trust each other and keep supporting each other if some of our teammate play not good and keep trusting and be confident and play like we practice.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Does that confidence come in part with communication as well or are your guys having a bit of communication issues?</p>
<p>Our communication is not...I mean from 100%, maybe 90% I believe. The 10% is sometimes miscommunication because I think some situation like 2v2 or 2v3 - for example DD and maybe xccurate, the different language, maybe if DD say something he just react too fast and speak Chinese that round, maybe xccurate (Kevin) doesn't understand like that because sometimes it's just their nature, but I think even though we don't have 100% communication our confidence is really good.</p>

<p class="interview-question">In the Chinese scene the big news coming out recently is ViCi.Flash, are you guys worried at all about them?</p>
<p>I'm not worried, but they are all my friends and I'm just happy they make a new team because I know they have a lot of strong individuals, same like the TyLoo guys. I hope they also can show what they are capable of in the international events.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Being in the Asian region, is it a lot of the time playing against the same teams over and over? or do you get a lot of experience out, like IEM Sydney now, with these top teams?</p>
<p>Yeah, if you don't go to the international tournament like this we practice in Asia and China and yeah we play with Asian teams, but I think before we already bootcamped in Europe and we learned so much from that and every time we go to a LAN we also practice.</p>

<p class="interview-question">So playing against a variety of different teams, helps learn a variety of different skills?</p>
<p>Yeah I think international level is very different to Asia. I think the teams in a clutch situation they are all so disciplined, but all the stuff like 'nades and go together, like the first people swing and the other one follow him in a very fast strat or something like that.</p>

<p class="interview-question">You guys came into this tournament and people weren't necessarily looking for anything special, but then you guys make it through to the semi-finals not dropping a single map going up against teams like SK and C9, was that a surprise to you guys as well?</p>
<p>Yeah, we didn't expect to go to the semi-final, our target was go to the playoffs and we beat SK and Cloud9, we just feel really amazing and boost our confidence up because they are one of the best teams in the world.</p>

<p class="interview-question">What is the local scene in China like? Is it easy for someone to come up through the ranks and play in the big teams?</p>
<p>I think all Chinese players have the same attitude about the game they are all very aggressive, but if sometimes if they offer a pick it makes them look strong and looks good. But yeah I believe China players have a lot of potential to become a top player.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Thanks for chatting to us, and good luck out there.</p>
