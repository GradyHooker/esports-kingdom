<p>[AMENDED 5/17] On May 13th, Richard Lewis released a video on Valve's new Conflict of Interest rule which is being implemented for the upcoming FaceIt London Major and the Qualifiers. The rule is very similar to the WESA Multi-team Ownership rule that was announced in March of 2017.</p>

<p>The rule as stated under the FACEIT Major Open Qualifier Rules, Section 6.7 is:</p>

{% include quote.html text="Teams and players should not have any financial interest in the success of any team that they are competing against. To participate in the 2018 Fall Major, players and teams are required to affirm that they have no business entanglement (including, but not limited to, shared managed, shared ownership of entities, licensing, and loans) with any other participating team or its players. If teams or players have an agreement or business arrangement that may be of concern, then please reach out to the tournament officials for further discussion."%}

<p>As Richard Lewis pointed out, the two largest organizations that this will affect are RFRSH and ESForce. Both own multiple teams in the Counter-Strike Professional scene.</p>

<p>AMENDMENT 5/17: In line with what Richard Lewis presented, many reporters in the past indicated that RFRSH was a shareholder in GODSENT, and the company did not correct them at the time. Lewis stated;
{% include quote.html text="I was simply repeating what has been reported by other journalists and reiterated by RFRSH themselves that they are looking to sell godsent."%}

<p>In order to uncover whether or not this was true, Esports Kingdom reached out to RFRSH, and we received prompt replies from the company. According to Steen Laursen, the VP of Communications and Brand;</p>

{% include quote.html text="We do not have ownership in GODSENT, which has been communicated on several occasions and which is also clearly indicated on our digital platforms, where we do not mention GODSENT under our properties."%}

<p>He later added, "We never had any stake in GODSENT," and, "We have not sold any parts of GODSENT but worked with the owners on different options including possible sale." This information is counter to what has been presented in the past, and Esports Kingdom will inquire at a later date how this misunderstanding was allowed to continue both in the community and in the esports news field.</p>
