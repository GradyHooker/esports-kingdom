<p>ORDER only entered the Counter-Strike scene in January, they have already competed in two international LANS with IEM Katowice and IEM Sydney. We sat down with one their players aliStair to talk about the Australian scene, the rapid rise to success and an infamous tweet that he sent from INS' account.</p>

{% include video.html video="UmdZ7N8cNfc" caption="Video of Interview with ORDER's aliStair at IEM Sydney" %}

<p class="interview-question">Grady: Hey man, normally I'd start off these interviews asking if it's their first time to Australis, but I got a feeling it isn't your first time.</p>
<p>aliStair: It is not, believe it or not; it is not my first time here. Been here for awhile now.</p> 

<p class="interview-question">In fact you have been to another IEM Sydney tournament, how does this one compare to last years?</p>
<p>Lats years was a lot different; you had 8 teams and shooeys were allowed back then, believe it or not, the good old days (laughs) Last year there was only 8 teams compared to 16 here so theres a bigger competition. This one turned out to be a lot more competitive, a lot more upsets, having more Australian teams compete which was awesome to see - especially actually putting up numbers.</p>

<p class="interview-question">You talked about upsets, obviously last year at this tournament you guys had a pretty big upset. Can you run my through, I was there in the studios watching you guys, what was the feelings between everybody there?</p>
<p>So we beat North 16-13 on Nuke. That was our second upset, because we had actually done really well against Renegades before that, we were 15-0 at halftime and finished on 16-5 which was cool. With North it was "Let's stay cool-headed, we've practiced this map so much". It was Nuke and we had a strategy we kept running, we kinda mind-gamed them a lot by not committing with it and then slowing it down, and they didn't really know how to react which was awesome and we took advantage of it. It definitely helped that INS was playing out of his mind, INS just shocked everybody; he was hitting taps, he was hitting deagles, we won an eco round because he had a deagle in his hand. Everybody had their moments, pecks did really well one round with another deagle, it was just phenomenal getting to verse that team. They were our first "major" team we got to verse and we kinda ran away with it 16-13
.</p>

<p class="interview-question">The thing that always sticks out in my head, it was a minute after the match and I don't remember which one of your guys said it, but I think the line was "This feels much better than beating Tainted online" or something like that...</p>
<p>I actually can't recall that, the only line I can actually remember after that was INS' tweet that got a lot of likes and retweets and stuff which was <a href="https://twitter.com/inscsgo/status/860015526541631488">"I eat ass"</a> (laughs) Which I actually did on his account and it got so many [engagements] I was like "Damn, I should have done that on mine". I did it on his as a troll and it blew up; pansy was tweeting about it, everybody was like "Yeah thats the kid that eats ass" and I was like "damn, that should have been me." (laughs)</p>

<p class="interview-question">Coming to a tournament like this, you get the take on international teams and this time you got to take on FaZe and Cloud9. Do you think you are going to take away anything from those games?</p>
<p>Absolutely, we stomped by FaZe for the second time - they domed us the first time 16-3 and then 16-4 this time, but then C9 we kinda shook them a bit. We got the first map 16-7 quite comfortably and then they stomped us back 16-4 and then double-OT the next. I definitely think we can only benefit from looking at those results, even though we went out in the fashion we did; the 15-13 never forget 4v1. It showed anything can happen, the odds can be stacked against you and you cans till make it so far against any team, it doesn't matter. So yeah, we built a lot of confidence versus C9.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Looking at all the Australian teams in this tournament, were you surprised by how well they were doing? and Asian teams as well, TyLoo in the semis.</p>
<p>Kinda, the top-tier CS right now is kinda rocky and there is no clear favorite; if I were to say it is probably Astralis right now. Australian Counter-Strike doesn't get to verse these teams often, so when they do the EUropean teams might not know what to expect and NA as well. So I think we had that under our belt, we were the underdogs and they may have underestimated us and definitely showed ourselves in this tournament. Australia is not a joke, we can compete with everybody including the best. Have a look at Grayhound taking out SK and doing really well against FaZe, us taking out C9 nearly, and TyLoo look how far they've made it - that was amazing. Yeah I definitely think Australia has a lot to show and the APAC region in general.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Talking about the APAC region and CSGO, ESL Pro League has expanded to include us as a region. How do you think that is going to benefit the APAC region?</p>
<p>Greatly, we've got Grayhound going over to Dallas and MVP, who have shown to be really strong recently. There's no downside to it, it is only positive as we can get more recognition and hopefully get more results, hopefully Grayhound go out into this tournament in Dallas with the same form they are at in this one and can show it wasn't a one-off and Australian teams can do this. Hopefully they can get us more exposure for other tournaments.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Obviously you are on ORDER now, previous to that though we had Kings. Can you explain a little bit about what actually happened there?</p>
<p>I was never actually in Kings, I joined the team as soon as they joined ORDER it was basically a double signing; they signed with ORDER, I signed with them. I was with Chiefs formally and I know no details about Kings. ORDER is a really good org, happy to be here and happy to have a brand that we have helped build - we haven't just tagged along, we were there from the start.</p>

<p class="interview-question">What was your motivation to jump from Chiefs over to ORDER?</p>
<p>I saw it as a good opportunity, I'd been with Chiefs for a long time and INS had just left. I just thought it was a great opportunity for me take and I took the chance. It's hard, but I've always wanted to compete in a major and I knew with the current rules in place I was not able to do that under Chiefs and I think with this lineup I can definitely make it to a major.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Other than yourselves and we will discount Renegades as well, what do you as the top Australian team?</p>
<p>Right now Grayhound probably have the best form, but it's completely subjective, if you ask anyone they will probably say Grayhound. We just have to back ourselves, I still think we are the best team in Australia even if we have not proven it; losing to Grayhound on LAN recently. They are doing really well and I'm not taking any credit away from them, they are beasting it right now, but I definitely think that when they come back from Dallas we will be number one again and we'll show everybody.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Last of all, do you bully the Kiwi boy at all?</p>
<p>Nah. He's from New Zealand so who knows, he might just turn on us and take us all on. So it's probably not worth bullying him (laughs). Nah, no bullying him (laughs).</p>

<p class="interview-question">Sweet, thanks a lot man.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
