<p>The fourth day in the scorching Texas heat has been wrapped up, so let's recap the day to get you ready for the Semifinals!</p>

<p class="subheading">Quarterfinal 1</p>

{% include team-info.html logo="liquid" logo2="mousesports" text="For the first Quarterfinal, mousesports had first map pick and they chose Mirage to start.. CT side went to Liquid, but the first 3 rounds were mouz's, thanks in large part to an <a href='https://clips.twitch.tv/EphemeralHorribleSalsifyThunBeast' target='_blank'>anti-eco ace</a> from Miikka “suNny” Kemppi. Liquid was able to respond with a quick trio of their own. Not to be outdone, mouz once again won 3 rounds in a row, but Liquid ended the whimsical back and forth by winning the final 6 rounds of the half. This gave them a decent 6:9 lead headed into the second half. Like the first half, mouz started the second half with several wins. They won the first 4 and 6 of the first 8 rounds. This was enough to allow them to retake the lead 12-11. Liquid again fought back with 4 more rounds to set up match point at 12-15. However through some tremendous play from Chris “ChrisJ” de Jong and <a href='https://clips.twitch.tv/MagnificentIcyBunnyBCouch' target='_blank'>3 kills</a> from his trusty AWP, mouz was able to send the game into over time. Overtime was a back and forth affair that meant we could only have one outcome, double OT! In double OT Team Liquid was finally able to win the game 22-20 on the final round of the second OT. The MVP here goes to Keith “NAF” Markovic for his 1.41 rating, the only rating above a 1.01 for his team. He also had a 39/11/24 stat line and a 101.5 ADR." %}

<p>Liquid chose the returning Dust 2 for their map in game 2. mouz started on CT, but Liquid took the pistol round due to a Russel “Twistzz” Van Dulken <a href='https://clips.twitch.tv/VictoriousSecretiveInternPartyTime' target='_blank'>quad kill</a>, and they also added the next 3 rounds. Though mouz took the 5th round, Liquid simply reset them and won 4 more. Then mouz won another round only to be reset by Liquid winning 3 more rounds. Finally mouz managed to string 2 rounds together to end the half and go into the second half at an 11-4 deficit. In the second half, Liquid never let mouz touch a round. 5 straight wins and the game and match were liquids, 15-4 and 2-0 respectively. MVP of the map goes to Jonathan “EliGE” Jablonowski for a 1.74 rating, 19/5/10 stat line, and a 96.6 ADR.</p>

<p class="subheading">Quarterfinal 2</p>

{% include team-info.html logo="skgaming" logo2="faze" text="SK chose Overpass to kick off Quarterfinal 2, and FaZe got the lucky CT side. They took the pistol round thanks to an <a href='https://clips.twitch.tv/BoringHelpfulRuffSaltBae' target='_blank'>amazing 1v4 clutch</a> by Finn “karrigan” Anderson. They proceeded to build a quick 7 round lead before SK was able to cut into it. SK fought back hard by winning 4 straight and 5 of the next 6, but they were not able to prevent FaZe from taking the final 2 rounds in the half. This gave FaZe a very strong 10-5 lead heading into the second half. In the second half, FaZe again took the first three rounds. This time the Brazilians were able to fight back, taking 7 of the next 8 rounds to close within two rounds 14-12. Unfortunately for SK, this was the closest they would get, as FaZe set up map point the next round and won it two rounds later. This gave FaZe a 16-13 map 1 win on SK's map pick. Map MVP goes to Nikola “NiKo” Kovač for a 1.65 Rating, 26/9/14 stat line, and a 111.5 ADR." %}

<p>Map 2 was Mirage, as chosen by FaZe, and SK started on CT. FaZe again started strong winning the first three rounds. SK managed to take the 4th round, but all that got them was a loss bonus reset. FaZe proceeded to win the next 10 rounds before finally losing the final round of the half to SK. During this span, NiKo had an 4v1 ace clutch. <a href='https://clips.twitch.tv/JoyousSpeedyManateeRaccAttack' target='_blank'>It was electrifying!</a> This run gave them an insurmountable half time lead of 13-2. They again won the pistol round in the second half, but this time SK was able to steal the eco and two more rounds. However, that was all they would get, as FaZe would easily close out the final 2 rounds to win the map 16-5 and the match 2-0. The map MVP was again NiKo for his tremendous ace clutch and his 1.51 rating and 20 kills.</p>
