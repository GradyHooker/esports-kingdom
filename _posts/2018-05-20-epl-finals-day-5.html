<p>The Grand Final teams are set, but first let's review what happened over the course of Day 5 during the Semifinals!</p>

<p class="subheading">Semifinal 1</p>

{% include team-info.html logo="liquid" logo2="navi" text="The first map of the semifinals was Liquid's pick of Dust 2. NaVi started on T side, but Liquid was the team to win the first pistol thanks to Keith “NAF” Markovic's 4K. They also won the anti-eco, but NaVi quickly secured the next 4 rounds. Though Liquid won another round, they were reset by NaVi who proceeded to win another 4 in a row. Again Liquid secured 1 more round and were reset by NaVi. This time they were able to sneak the next round and the final round of the half to manage to only go into half down 6-9. In the second half, NaVi won the first 2 rounds to take a commanding 6-12 lead. Liquid did not allow NaVi to close them out. They won the next 3 round before NaVi could steal another. However Liquid reset their loss bonus and won the next 6 rounds straight to come back and take the lead 15-13. NaVi was able to send it to the 30th round, but Liquid would not allow their comeback to end in vain. Liquid took the final round to win 16-14. MVP of the map was Epitacio “TACO” de Melo for his 1.26 rating, and 23/4/18 stat line." %}

<p>NaVi chose Inferno for their map, and Liquid picked CT to start. It was a good pick, as they started the map 8-0 before NaVi was finally able to string together 3 rounds. Liquid then won 3 of the next 4 rounds to close out the half and go into the second half with a overwhelming 11-4 lead. In the second half, Liquid again won the pistol round and the anti-eco. NaVi took the next two rounds. Liquid reached match point by winning 2 of the next 3 rounds, but NaVi wasn't willing to just let them win it. NaVi took 3 more rounds before Liquid was able to secure the map and match 16-10 and 2-0. MVP of the map was Johnathan “EliGE” Jablonowski. He had a 1.54 rating 24/11/17 stat line, and a 105.4 ADR.</p>

<p class="subheading">Semifinal 2</p>

{% include team-info.html logo="astralis" logo2="faze" text="FaZe picked Mirage for the first map of the second semifinal, the rematch of the Grand Final from Sydney. Astralis took CT side and the first 3 rounds. FaZe won the next two rounds, but Astralis bounced right back and took the next 6 rounds. FaZe managed to squeeze in a win, but were reset and were not able to win another round the rest of the half. This put them at a horrible 12-3 disadvantage going into the second half. It didn't matter how large the lead was anyways as Astralis decided to just end the map,, winning the final 4 rounds in the second half to win the map 16-3. Magisk gets the map MVP for a tremendous 1.81 Rating, 21/3/6 stat line, and a 100.8 ADR." %}

<p>The second map was Astralis's pick of Inferno. FaZe choose CT side, but it was not a cure to their ails from the first game. Astralis won the first 9 rounds before a FaZe even managed a single round. FaZe took 2 of the next 3 rounds, but then Astralis again won the next 3 straight to go into the second half with an even stronger lead than the first game, 13-2. In the second half, Astralis started off by reaching match point in the first 2 rounds. FaZe staved off the inevitable for 4 more rounds, but Astralis closed it out 16-6, and swept their rivals 2-0. This time the MVP of the map was Lukas “gla1ve” Rossasnder with a 23/8/10 stat line, 114.1 ADR , and a terrific 1.86 Rating.</p>
