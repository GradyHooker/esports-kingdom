<p>At IEM Sydney Fnatic's Lekr0 took some time out of the weekend to sit down (actually stand up) and have a chat to us about their performance in the tournament, the false reports around replacing Golden and what their plans are heading into the ECS Finals.</p>

{% include video.html video="Oe3weYQISDQ" caption="Video of Interview with Fnatic's Lekr0 at IEM Sydney" %}

<p class="interview-question">Grady: Is it your first time here in Australia?</p>
<p>Lekr0: Yeah it's my first time.</p> 

<p class="interview-question">Have you been able to go around and do any touristy stuff here?</p>
<p>Not really, not yet, I've been around the hotel and stuff like that, but I haven't been to the city or to the Opera House and stuff like that. Hopefully tomorrow I think we have got some time.</p>

<p class="interview-question">At the moment for your ingame-leader you've got Golden, he has come up from the academy team, is it working?</p>
<p>Yeah it is working pretty good actually, although overall this event no one really played well or together at all. It's been going pretty good I think.</p>

<p class="interview-question">There were rumors swirling around about a replacement, did Golden know about that or did it come out of nowhere?</p>
<p>I think the false accusations got known pretty fast that they were a bad report, so it was pretty fine.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Did that demoralize anybody or did everyone know "I'm safe, it's a nothing thing"?</p>
<p>Yeah I think some of us were pretty surprised about that something like that even came out, but we dealt with it good I think.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Talking about this tournament, you won Katowice, won WESG, 3rd/4th in Marseille. So was there anything you can put the finger on as the blame for this tournament or was it just practise and prep?</p>
<p>I'm not really sure, sometimes when we get a bad start or get crushed like we did against Astralis, we tend to get very...it's not how we play ingame, it is more how we are outside of the game and it affect us a lot; we don't help each other ingame if we play a bad game before or something like that.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Is that something that you guys are actively trying to fix through bootcamps or something like that?</p>
<p>Not through bootcamps, but just being aware of the problems we have and hopefully try to fix them.</p>

<p class="interview-question">In this tournament, Dust2 came back, first event in the active duty pool and you guys got to play it. How was that? Did you guys expect to be playing it in this tournament?</p>
<p>Yeah I thought we would play more Dust2 actually, as third maps, but we only got the chance one time - the other time we lsot 2-0 so we wouldn't have got to play it anyway. We expected to play it, but I still don't like the map at all.</p>

<p class="interview-question">So for your personally it is a bad addition to the map pool then?</p>
<p>Yeah, I don't like it at all.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Did the team go out of their way specifically to practice Dust2? or did you just head into it completely open?</p>
<p>Yeah we played Dust2 now for four days in a row for the tournament, because we only had four days. We had to do what we could in those four days.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Fnatic lost dennis, lost olof; there have been a couple of roster movements around. How hard or how quickly do you get back to normal after a movement like that?</p>
<p>I think it goes pretty fast - it either clicks or it doesn't most of the time. So if you get a good start, like if you have something going on like a bad start, you just have to find it and sometimes people give up if you don't find it early. We found it pretty quickly I think, we had good results online and stuff like that so it wasn't that bad for us.</p>

<p class="interview-question">So you five are all settled and good now?</p>
<p>Yeah I think we are good now.</p>

<p class="interview-question">You guys are not as the Dallas EPL Finals, so you have got a bit of a break, what are you guys going to do between now and your next tournament?</p>
<p>I'm not really sure what we are going to do. We are probably not going to practice, or stuff like that, for quite awhile. Before ECS we are gonna practice, but for now it's vacation time kinda.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Thanks for having your time today man.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
