<p>Fresh off their IEM Sydney dominance and just before their semifinal against mousesports we got to talk to Astralis' MVP of the tournament, Magisk. We chat about; coming into a top team, Astralis' current wave of momentum and their huge map pool.</p>

{% include video.html video="exo15zo5yFo" caption="Video of Interview with Astralis' Magisk at IEM Sydney" %}

<p class="interview-question">Grady: Is it your first time in Australia?</p>
<p>Magisk: No, it's my second time.</p> 

<p class="interview-question">Did you guys do all the touristy stuff you did last time or did you just get straight to business?</p>
<p>This time we didn't really see so much, this time it was more just playing and watching the tournament.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Astralis is coming with a major wave of momentum winning in the last tournament and coming into this one. Do you think that momentum has helped you guys through this tournament?</p>
<p>I think it's always tough just winning a tournament and then going straight to the next one especially because everyone is anti-strating you. You kind of just go home for a few days and you just have to go straight into business again - you don't really have time to be happy about the win you just go and play again and it's the same. It's tough because you have that mental thing that you have to keep focusing and try and win everything, again.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Do you think that your team is currently in an upswing in terms of performance or do you think this is just sort of a blip on the radar?</p>
<p>We're definitely playing better and better that's for sure. We just won Marseille and this tournament we at least got into the semi-finals so far, so that's pretty good. I feel like we just slowly fix the mistakes that we are making in the games and making progress all the time, but you can definitely feel that all the teams is like trying to catch up to you and anti-strating and using some of the same tactics as you used, so that's definitely making it more difficult.
</p>

<p class="interview-question">You are in the semi-finals, you're gonna be going up against the winner of Renegades vs. mousesports - Which one would you prefer to go up against?</p>
<p>To be honest I don't really care, we have played mousesports many times now and I feel like we have the upper hand every time,  especially because our map pool is much bigger and really good against them. Renegades, they have the home crowd so that's one thing, but I feel like we are a better team if we just play our own game. Our map pool is probably the best in the world right now, so I don't feel like there's any team in the world who's gonna have an advantage from the map pool right now at least - so that's that's a good sign.</p>

<p class="interview-question">You mentioned map pools, we just got Dust2 back. What does that done to your guys's map pool? Has it changed it up?</p>
<p>It's made it even better to be honest, especially because Cobble was our permanent ban. So Cobble was a map we didn't want to play before, we did practice it in the end, but now that it's removed we only practice Dust2  before this tournament - we didn't play any other map. We hardcore went to that map and just only practiced it, so that's only a good thing because we don't mind playing it against any of the teams here.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Yourself; North, OpTic...it's been a journey to get here. So how exactly did all the stars align and you end up on Astralis?</p>
<p>I mean it came out of nowhere, especially because Kjaerbye decided to leave himself, so I got the chance and I'm pretty happy about that especially because we are doing so well at the moment. It's pretty nice that when you're coming into a new team who has high expectations and of least being a top three team in the world all the time, it's nice to at least have reached that level now and from now on it's just about staying there and keep going and trying to improve all the time.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>No problem.</p>
