<p>MVP PK attended IEM Sydney and were heading to Dallas for ESL Pro League right after, but we got some time with XigN and with the help of MPV's coach termi were able to have a short interview.</p>

{% include video.html video="zgQguxBgqwA" caption="Video of Interview with MVP PK's XigN at IEM Sydney" %}

<p class="interview-question">Grady: You guys came into IEM Sydney, what were your expectations coming into here?</p>
<p>XigN: We have a competition to know our level.</p> 

<p class="interview-question">You got to take on some top teams like G2 Esports and mousesports. Do you think you learned anything from playing top teams like that?</p>
<p>They were great competition and I realized that strategy and tactics were not everything.</p>

<p class="interview-question">You guys are heading to Dallas as a part of the ESL Pro League, what are you guys hoping to do in Dallas?</p>
<p>I want to show a lot of things and challenge new teams.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Cool. Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
