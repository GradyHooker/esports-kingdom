<p>After a disappointing result at IEM Sydney, SK Gaming's player boltz talks to us about the surprise that was the Australian teams, the internet hate directed towards him and adapting to Stewie2K and using English for the calls.</p>

{% include video.html video="vVCXmUzt3ZU" caption="Video of Interview with SK Gaming's boltz at IEM Sydney" %}

<p class="interview-question">Grady: Is this your first time here in Australia?</p>
<p>boltz: Yeah it's been the first time and it's been really good, I really like the place and the crowd - it's been good.</p> 

<p class="interview-question">Have you been able to get around and see much of what Australia has to offer?</p>
<p>Not much, much we just played the tournament, practiced a lot, so I hope in the next few days and I'm gonna see harbours and towers and everything.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Obviously not the result you'd want in this tournament, is a sort of a reason that you can point to or is it just a thing that happened?</p>
<p>Yeah, we are still adapting for how we are gonna play and playing with Stew, so it's kind of new team and he's been on the team for just one month so we need to work on a lot of things, a lot of some mistakes we are doing. It's not expected, but we need to play better for sure.</p>

<p class="interview-question">There has been a lot of changes at the moment and there were rumors everywhere about different players coming in. How does hard is that to handle as a team in terms of not necessarily knowing you know who's gonna be on the team next week?</p>
<p>Yeah it's kind of hard, but we need to focus and play our game and try to work as hard as we can to improve. So that's it; need to focus on our game and playing the tournaments.</p>

<p class="interview-question">A lot of the times the internet is a harsh place, you seem to take a brunt of a lot of the internet hate. Is that getting to you? Do you just have to have a thick skin?</p>
<p>It don't matter for me, I know I'm not playing the best I can. It's been really hard for me too, I'm playing a lot of other spots that are new for me, but I'm really working hard to play better; I know I can and I hope the next term is gonna be good for me and for the team.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Greyhound and the Australian teams were they a surprise to you? Did you not expect them to come out of the gates where they did?</p>
<p>Yeah of course I'm surprised, I think not just us, everyone including FaZe - they almost beat them too. For sure they surprised, because no one knows in the international scene how they are and how they play, so it's kind of surprises us for sure and they are doing well. It's not lucky, in a bo3 they almost beat FaZe so they are playing good for sure.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Do you prefer to play the same teams over and over or come to a new region like this and play some newer guys that you haven't met before?</p>
<p>I think it's good to be in another place and other scenes, so they get the chance to prove themselves; like Grayhound, like ORDER, almost beat Cloud9 too and it's good for the other teams too, other regions to create their own league. It's good I think, it's good for Counter-Strike.</p>

<p class="interview-question">We talked about roster changes, you've got Stewie now. How is that working out? Is it just a process of getting him into the roles?</p>
<p>Yeah, we need to work on a lot of things; communication in English is kinda new for us, how he he wants to play and how he likes to play and how he wants to be in the team playing with each other. So it's kind of been really harsh in the beginning, but he is working really hard to fix everything for the next tournaments.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Is SK as a team adapting to Stewie or Stewie adapting to SK?</p>
<p>I think it's kinda both. Everyone needs to adapt for everything; if he likes to do something we need to adapt, if he wants to do something he needs to adapt for us and I think that there is things as a team no matter what he wants to do, we need to weigh in.</p>

<p class="interview-question">You mentioned communication, so is it 100% English calls now?</p>
<p>Yeah I think 90% Sometimes when he dies and we are at an important part with pressure we can talk in Portuguese sometimes, try to to talk in our normal language. So we're trying to do everything we can to to put Stew in the team and try English almost all the time.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Sweet. Thanks a lot man.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
