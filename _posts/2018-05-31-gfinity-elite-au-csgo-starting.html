<p>This weekend is the first round of play for the brand new Gfinity Elite Series AU league. It will be streamed live on Twitch each weekend for 6 weeks from the Gfinity Arena in Sydney with 6 of the top Australian teams going head-to-head each week. First up, lets look at the six teams that you see play in the league.</p>

{% include logoheadline.html logo="brisbane-deceptors" headline="Brisbane Deceptors" %} 

{% include teamlist.html logo="brisbane-deceptors" players="konii|Artemis|Peachy|Raizy|Riv|m0nt (Sub)|gotz (Sub)|Mattcd (Sub)|JD (Draftee)|YetiBacon (Draftee)" country="AU|AU|NZ|CN|AU|AU|AU|AU|AU|AU" %}

<p>The Brisbane Deceptors have taken a unique approach by assembling an entirely female starting roster of Counter-Strike players to fight in this league. Their starting five players are the females who had previously played as Kings GC Female (Raizy, Artemis, konii, Peachy) combined with Riv to form the Sydney Saints, who defeated Control fe in the ESL Women's Sydney Open Finals during IEM Sydney. The substitutes and draftees come from all around Australia and teams such as MC, Conspiracy, Control, and some who are currently orgless.</p>

{% include teamlist.html logo="avantgarde" players="MoeycQ|zeph|DANZ|urbz|HaZR|pecks (Sub)|breaker (Draftee)|jhd (Draftee)|fakedaN (Draftee)" country="AU|AU|AU|AU|AU|AU|AU|AU|HR" %}

<p>Avant Garde have a history in Counter-Strike and had only just recently released their previous roster in April, assembling this team in May. MoeycQ came over once Athletico released their roster in February while the duo of urbz and DANZ are ex-Corvidae and left to join this new combination, finally rounding out the team is HaZR previously from Ground Zero and zeph from Lucky7. Together and under the Avant Garde brand the only true showcase they have so far has been the Oceania Open Qualifier for the Asia Minor for London Major 2018 - they managed to defeat Yoink 16-1, but ultimately fell in the Quarterfinals to Team Streamline 11-16.</p>

{% include logoheadline.html logo="order" headline="Melbourne ORDER" %} 

{% include teamlist.html logo="order" players="emagine|liazz|Hatz|sico|aliStair|sonic (Sub)|mizu (Sub)|RaZ (Sub)|NikkeZ (Sub)|spookr (Draftee)|swede (Draftee)|towski (Draftee)" country="AU|AU|AU|NZ|AU|AU|AU|NZ|AU|AU|AU|AU" %}

<p>In January ORDER signed the former Kings Gaming Club roster and added in the secret sauce of aliStair to round out the team. Together they have already shown to be a strong side taking home earnings of roughly $72,500 and winning the; WESG Asia-Pacific Finals, IEM Katowice Oceania Qualifier, ESEA Season 28 Premier AU, ESL Pro League Season 7 ANZ and qualified for IEM Sydney. This is my early favorite in the tournament, they have a lot of experience together and have proven results as one of Australia's top Counter-Strike teams.</p>

{% include logoheadline.html logo="groundzero" headline="Perth Ground Zero" %} 

{% include teamlist.html logo="groundzero" players="willyKS|Xtinct|waffe|Kaotik|InJect|PeetyG (Coach)|apocdud (Sub)|xeL (Draftee)|Dissonance (Draftee)" country="ID|AU|AU|AU|AU|AU|AU|AU|AU" %}

<p>Ground Zero Gaming have had shaky results as of late being able to defeat weaker teams such as Conspiracy, balkrew and R!OT in the ESL Mountain Dew League and ESL ANZ Championship, but also struggling against the big boys like Tainted Minds and Chiefs eSports Club. The x-factor for this team is going to be the addition of PeetyG this month, grabbing him after Athletico dissolved and bringing his experience into the leadership of the lineup.</p>

{% include logoheadline.html logo="chiefs" headline="Sydney Chiefs" %} 

{% include teamlist.html logo="chiefs" players="ap0c|flickz|dizzy|INS|BURNRUOk|MAGICKKK (Coach)|badge (Sub)|pili (Sub)|busta (Sub)|IyeN (Sub)|Hazz (Sub)|tama (Draftee)|Doom (Draftee)" country="AU|AU|AU|AU|AU|AU|AU|AU|AU|AU|NZ|AU|AU" %}

<p>Chiefs eSports Club is an interesting case in this tournament as their regular lineup features tucks as the captain and Texta, both of which are VAC-banned and ineligible to play in this tournament and in their place they are not fielding inactive players pecks or st3rl1ng. Instead we see Chiefs look over to another Australian team Tainted Minds to borrow the devastating duo of INS and BURNRUOk to complete the starting five.</p>

{% include logoheadline.html logo="sydney-roar" headline="Sydney Roar" %} 

{% include teamlist.html logo="sydney-roar" players="Havoc|topguN|deStiny|wizard|chuch|InfrequeNt (Sub)|INSANITY (Draftee)|Dezibel (Draftee)" country="AU|AU|AU|AU|AU|AU|AU|AU" %}

<p>In March we saw the return of Auzzie CS legends Havoc and topguN in a brand new Athletico roster built around new talent in the scene, but after 3 months that fell apart just before IEM Sydney. Roar have picked up that duo and tacked on deStiny (ex-Corvidae), wizard (ex-Kings GC) and chuch (ex-Tainted Minds) to create what is an untested jumble of a roster and my dark horse pick for this league.</p>

<p>You can catch all the action on Saturday at 3PM AEST (1AM EST) on <a href='https://www.twitch.tv/GfinityAU'>Twitch.tv/GfinityAU</a> with the first three matches;</p>
