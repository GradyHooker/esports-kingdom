<p>This is the first in what will become a regular segment on Esports Kingdom. Grady and Jamie get together after every major LAN and instead of ranking the teams based on their recent performance, they place their top 30 teams into tiers with other teams at their skill-level.</p>

<p>Tier Rankings compiled by Jamie "PalmtopPitbull" Wert (<a href="https://twitter.com/PalmtopPitbull">@PalmtopPitbull on Twitter</a>) and Grady Hooker (<a href="https://twitter.com/GradyHooker">@GradyHooker on Twitter</a>).</p>

<li>S-Tier is for teams that you expect to win every tournament they are in and are currently sitting on the top of the Counter-Strike scene.</li>

<li>A-Tier is teams that have had major success recently and you can expect to get upsets against the S-Tier teams on a regular basis and usually makes the playoffs.</li>

<li>B-Tier teams are ones that have shown potential in recent tournaments, but are not performing on the level of an or A-Tier or S-Tier team.</li>

<li>C-Tier is for teams that may have dropped off recently, but have historically had decent showings at international LANs, can potentially make the playoffs.</li>

<li>D-Tier is for teams who have appeared at a few international LANs recently, most likely via qualifiers, but have not shown skill consistently on the level of the other tiers.</li>
