<p>Just now a new update dropped for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive that contains changes to both the CZ-75 and M4A1-S weapons, as well as changes for the Mirage and Canals maps.</p>

<p class="subheading">Weapon Changes</p>

<li>Reduced base damage of the CZ75a from 33 to 31 (a single shot is no longer lethal against a helmeted opponent).</li>

<li>Increased reserve ammo for the M4A1-S from 40 to 60, to provide some additional utility without impacting brief engagements.</li>

<li>Reduced price of the MP7 from $1700 to $1500.</li>

<p class="subheading">Mirage Changes</p>
