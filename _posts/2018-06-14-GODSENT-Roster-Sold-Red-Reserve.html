<p>Red Reserve, a team that dissolved their previous roster last month, has purchased the entire roster of GODSENT. The team was being sold by owners Markus Wallsten and Tomas Oropesa. RFRSH Entertainment, while not owners, operated and managed the team for the pair of owners.</p>

<p>However, new rule sets that came out last year for the WESA and this year for the FACEIT Major made it so that ownership and operating groups could not have their hands in more than one team to prevent possible conflicts of interest. This sale is likely to have been made as a result of these new rules.</p>

<p>The CEO of Red Reserve, Patrik Andersson released the statement:</p>

{% include quote.html text="We are very excited to announce our reentry into Counter-Strike:Global Offensive with the acquisition of the GODSENT roster. We have come to a purchase agreement with the GODSENT owners for the full roster consisting of Joakim 'Disco Doplan√¢' Gidetun, Simon 'Twist' Eliasson, Fredik 'Freddieb' Buo, Hampus 'Hampus' Poser, Ludvig 'Brollan' Brolin, and Coach Niko 'naSu' Kovanen."%}

{% include quote.html text=" The team has been on a steady climb and is performing increasingly well. The roster (which combines for over $200,000 in career earnings) is currently ranked 17th Worldwide/8th in Europe, and recent finishes include 3rd - 4th at Dreamhack Open Tours and 6th at ECS Season 5. The team will next compete at Dreamhack Summer (Jonkoping, Sweden) on June 17th - June 20th for $100,000 among seven other qualified teams including Optic Gaming and Complexity."%}

<p>Simon 'Twist' Eliasson, a founding player of the team also released a statement:</p>

{% include quote.html text="I am really happy teaming up with Red Reserve we as a team will continue doing our best to reach our goals for the future, Id like to thank GODSENT/rfrsh for the time being its been one hell of a learning experience for me being one of the 'founders' in godsent. Id like to also thank every godsent player ive played with from start to end. Especially znajder and pronax which i have shared some of the best moments in my life with."%}

{% include quote.html text="Counter-Strike:Global Offensive is the fastest growing esports with a prize pool in 2017 was nearly $20M USD and in 2018 this number will be significantly higher. With 40 million players globally and a massive number of non-players also watching the big tournaments online, the exposure is significant. There are several major tournaments and events; in Scandinavia, BLAST Pro Series in Copenhagen had more than 5 million online viewers and internationally the major tournaments regularly draw millions of viewers."%}

<p>The movement of this team according to RFRSH Entertainment now means they are 'no longer involved with the GODSENT brand and has no contractual obligations to the players.' Though they may have relieved themselves of affiliation with GODSENT, RFRSH still have both Astralis and Heroic associated with their brand. This will likely need to be rectified by the time the FACEIT Major arrives if both teams qualify.</p>
