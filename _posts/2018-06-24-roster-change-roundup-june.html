<p>We're reviving an old column in light of this year's rather volatile roster changes. This will be done weekly, but only in weeks where relevant roster changes have taken place. This week's installment will be a special covering the last 2 weeks.</p>

{% include logoheadline.html logo="fiercetiger" headline="Fierce Tiger Disbands" %}

<p>Last month Chinese team Fierce Tiger was involved in a number of scandals and controversy, including one of their players, Kun 'LEo' Hou, being banned for cheating, and the team playing with LEo in the very next tournament using a different account. This week, HLTV broke the story that Fierce Tiger was disbanding, releasing all players except for LEo from their contracts. The now free agents are:</p>

{% include quote.html text="We are grateful to Luminosity for this opportunity. The LG jersey carries a big history in CS:GO. We have had some time to reflect on the past and realize some of our mistakes. We've grown as people outside the game and it will help us as teammates in the future. We are hungry as ever. The same feeling we had in Games Academy. We want to bring Luminosity CS:GO back to the top where it belongs and make all of our fans proud. We will earn your respect and your cheer. Thank you"%}
