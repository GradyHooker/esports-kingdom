<p>ESL have announced that IEM Sydney's online viewership has seen a massive increase of 75% from last year with 13.5 million unique viewers tuning in and that over 7,500 people attended the live event each day.</p>

{% include video.html video="5VSTTw54MQQ" caption="ESL's IEM Sydney post-event wrap video" %}

<p>This year the group stage was bolstered up with sixteen teams from across the world and from the local CSGO scene in Australasia including; Grayhound Gaming, Chiefs Esports Club, Legacy Esports and ORDER from Australia. Grayhound Gaming had the upset of the tournament by taking out the Brazilian team SK Gaming, who won the IEM Sydney tournament in 2017, early in the group stages. The playoffs were held in the Qudos Bank Arena and Renegades, who were the last Australian-based team left, were eventually eliminated by European side mousesports in the semi-finals. The grand final was set between last year's runners-up FaZe Clan and a strong Danish side Astralis, ultimately FaZe pulled out the 3-0 win and took home the lionâs share of $310,000AUD and the title of IEM Sydney 2018 Champions.</p>

<p>John Bonini, Vice President/GM of the VR, Gaming and Esports Group at Intel Corporation commented on the event:</p>

{% include quote.html text="Intel Extreme Masters Sydney has quickly become one of the most exciting tournaments in the region, and is a testament to the strength of the industry that is engaging more than 380 million fans around the world. At Intel, we know that the PC is the best place to game and our goal is to continue innovating in the technology that will reshape the gaming landscape."%}

<p>Along with the crowd of over 7,500 fans visiting the stadium on each event day, online broadcast of IEM Sydney 2018 was delivered to 56 digital and linear destinations in 20 languages, and surpassed viewership figures from last years event, reaching over 13.5 million unique online viewers (up +75% Year on Year). More than 8.4 million hours of content was watched by viewers, an increase of 232% YoY.</p>

<p>We also can't forget about the ESL Community Stage which hosted the ESL Womenâs Sydney Open Presented by Vodafone, a two-day live tournament of which the Sydney Saints took home the victory. The Community Stage was also home to the StarCraft II WCS Challenger OCE-SEA qualifiers, which saw Seither and NXZ qualify for a spot at WCS Austin. Social media across the ESL Community Stage saw fans engage with local content over 11,000 times on all platforms, with over 500,000 impressions delivered on local channels.</p>
