<p>The Australia Esports Federation (AEF) announced they will be running their first ever Counter-Strike tournament. The AEF are known around Australia for their DOTA 2 tournaments, but are looking to the Oceanic region for CSGO players to compete.</p>

<p>The registrations are now open for Counter-Strike teams from Australia, New Zealand and surrounding Oceanic regions, registrations will remain open until the 4th of August 2018. The online phase will start on the 13th of August and run until around 7th of September with the top two teams selected to proceed.</p>

<p>The next phase will see eight teams, a mixture of direct invites and teams from the open qualifier, go head-to-head in a round-robin style with 2 groups of 4 teams. The top two teams from each group proceed on to play in a double-elimination bracket, and then the two finalists from that will play in the grand final LAN main event in a best-of-5.</p>

<p>The venue and date for the LAN main event are still TBD, but AEF say to expect confirmation in the next 2 weeks, stay tuned to their social media pages: <a href='https://www.facebook.com/ausesportsfed/'>Facebook</a> and <a href='https://twitter.com/ausesportsfed'>Twitter</a>.</p>
