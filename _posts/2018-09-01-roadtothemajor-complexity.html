<p class="subheading">Year to Date</p>

<p>compLexity fell from relevance for quite some time until reemerging late in 2017. In 2018 they have started to slowly emerge from obscurity, but still have not shown any super high placements in LANs.</p>

<p class="subheading">Player to Watch</p>

<p>Jacob 'yay' Whiteaker</p>

<p>He is another of the North American young guns to watch this Challengers Stage. Unlike SicK he does not have Major experience, so he will need to prove he belongs. This could be his breakout moment, or one that relegates him to relative obscurity.</p>
