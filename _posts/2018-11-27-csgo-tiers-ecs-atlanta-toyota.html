<p>Astralis got to show once again why they are the undisputed, reigning, defending champions of Counter-Strike right now by taking out the ECS Season 6 finals this past weekend. That wasn't the only tournament effecting the rankings this edition as we also had DreamHack Atlanta and the Toyota Masters in Bangkok.</p>

<p class="subheading">Reasons for Selected Teams (Movement or Roster Changes)</p>

<p>MIBR (+1) - They showed they could continue to compete at a high level. With them on the cusp, it is likely they will continue to move up and down if they keep having mixed performances.</p>

<p>BIG (-1) - BIG really needs to start going to more events if they want to prove they belong in the higher echelons.</p>

<p>ENCE (-1) - Like BIG they just don't go to enough big name events and play against enough relevant teams to warrant keeping them in B Tier.</p>

<p>TyLoo (-1) - Yes they got 2nd at the Toyota Master's event, but they ultimately lost to a D Tier team in the finals, and it was their only significant LAN play in quite some time.</p>

<p>Vitality (Debut) - Vitality, a new team with a lot of familiar names burst onto the scene with their win at DreamHack Atlanta.</p>

<p>eUnited (Removed) - It's less what they did that got them dropped, and more that we needed to drop someone for Vitality, and they felt like the best pick.</p>

<p class="subheading">Explanation of Tiers</p>

<li>S-Tier: Teams you expect to win every tournament they are in. They are the current kings of the Counter-Strike scene.</li>

<li>A-Tier: Teams that can be expected to easily beat teams in the tiers below, and may even upset an S-Tier team once in a while. Regularly makes the playoffs.</li>

<li>B-Tier: Teams that; Have shown recent potential or Former A-Tier teams with recent and extended periods of poor play.</li>

<li>C-Tier: Teams that; Have had decent showings at recent international LANs or Teams that may have dropped off recently, but have historically decent placements and can potentially make the playoffs.</li>

<li>D-Tier: Teams that have appeared at a few international LANs recently, likely via qualifiers, but have not shown skill consistently on the level of the other tiers. Rarely make playoffs if they ever have.</li>

<p>These rules are not exact, and they are not hard and fast. There are always exceptions. If there were not, it would become impossible to rank teams due to the nature of the game.</p>
