<p>Yesterday LetsPlay.Live announced that they have acquired the oceanic esports platform CyberGamer. CyberGamer has been around since 2007 and has been utilized for multiple oceanic region qualifiers, while also hosting ladders, leagues and forums for discussion.</p>

<p>CyberGamer was started by two gamers, Jeremy "Asterix" Klaosen, and James "sn@p!" Burroughs, and over it's time has been home to 12,500,105 unique users around the globe and 387,741 registered members from the Australia & New Zealand regions.</p>

<p>Jeremy Klaosen, one of the founders of CyberGamer, will be joining LetsPlay.Live as the Head of Platform to continue the work on the CyberGamer platform, now with additional resources:</p>
