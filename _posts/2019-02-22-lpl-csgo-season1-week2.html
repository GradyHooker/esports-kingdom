<p>LetsPlay.Live's CS:GO ANZ Championship continued along this week with some overtime and some stomping. Also, we see Tainted Minds be acquired and re-branded to ICON Esports, just before their match against AVANT this week.</p>

<p class="subheading">Results</p>

<p style="display: flex; align-content: center;">{% include logo.html logo="groundzero" size="tiny" %} <span style="padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px;">16 - 13</span> {% include logo.html logo="genuine" size="tiny" %}</p>

<p>THE PILLAR! THE PILLAR! THE PILLAR!</p>

<p>Genuine had everything they needed to win this map and actually looked really good on the day, but got unlucky in almost every situation that could have gone either way. Genuine even had the top-fragger of the server with ap0c ending the map with 36 kills, the second highest being Ground Zero's Zemp on 29 kills. Let's not take anything away from Ground Zero as they worked hard to win this match on Mirage and constantly had to clutch the game back.</p>

<p style="display: flex; align-content: center;">{% include logo.html logo="breakaway" size="tiny" %} <span style="padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px;">19 - 15</span> {% include logo.html logo="athletico" size="tiny" %}</p>

<p>Breakaway came into Inferno as the favorite after their 16-1 win last week, but it looked scary early on with Breakaway only being able to get 1 round out of the first 11. They was falling apart in the early moments of this match on their CT-side and then after the half-time break a new fire was lit under Breakaway who just clawed rounds back, mostly by bomb explosion, until they managed to tie the game up 15-15.</p>

<p>Athletico surprised everyone with the fight they brought to regulation, but when it went to overtime they started on the CT-side, which was their weaker side in regular time, and couldn't mount a single round. That left Breakaway in a really strong position only requiring one round to take the match and they got it first try in the second half of overtime.</p>

<p style="display: flex; align-content: center;">{% include logo.html logo="icon" size="tiny" %} <span style="padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px;">16 - 1</span> {% include logo.html logo="avant" size="tiny" %}</p>

<p>ICON (fka. Tainted Minds) were coming off a hard-fought loss last week against Chiefs and didn't want to see the L again heading into Mirage against AVANT. Round 8 is all AVANT saw for the entire game and it wasn't even decisive because it came down to bomb explosion. There isn't a whole lot to say about this match as ICON were just the better team, plain and simple, and showed that to everyone watching.</p>

<p style="display: flex; align-content: center;">{% include logo.html logo="paradox" size="tiny" %} <span style="padding-left: 8px; padding-right: 8px;">16 - 8</span> {% include logo.html logo="chiefs" size="tiny" %}</p>

<p>tucks and co. just couldn't find a answer to Paradox as they collided on Inferno. Chiefs started out on the easier CT-side and were only able to mount 6 rounds in that half thanks to heroics from Valiance, Noobster, sibe...and keeyto and screw it Chub as well - the entire team of Paradox were rolling in that game. Once we got to the second half and Paradox took the pistol round it was just a matter of time before Chiefs fell to the now 1-1 Paradox.</p>
