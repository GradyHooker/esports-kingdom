<p>The next team in our series is the people's champion, ENCE. Made up of the best 5 Finnish players in Counter-Strike, they have made quite a splash recently - but can they continue on their trip to the top? or will the bubble burst?</p>

<p class="subheading">Roster</p>

{% include teamlist.html logo="ence" players="Aleksi 'allu' Jalli|Aleksi 'Aleksib' Virolainen|Jere 'sergej' Salo|Jani 'Aerial' Jussila|Sami 'xseveN' Laasanen|Slaava 'Twista' Räsänen (Coach)" country="FI|FI|FI|FI|FI|FI" %}	

<p class="subheading">Performance</p>

<p>Following their amazing upstart performance at the Katowice Major, ENCE has kept busy and performed at a fairly high level. They have attended BLAST Pro Series Sao Paulo(3rd) and Madrid(1st), StarSeries i-League Season 7(5-8th), cs_summit 4(4th), and DreamHack Masters Dallas(2nd).</p>

<p>At these events they have lost Bo3s to NaVi(StarSeries) and Vitality(StarSeries, cs_summit), and Liquid(DreamHack Masters Dallas). In comparison, they have won Bo3s against FaZe(StarSeries, DH Masters), Spirit(StarSeries), ViCi(StarSeries), FURIA(DH Masters), and G2(DH Masters).</p>

<p>They also succeeded in ending Astralis' Nuke undefeated streak at BLAST Pro Series Madrid.</p>

<p class="subheading">Important Stats</p>

<p>Jere 'sergej' Salo has been leading the team over the 50 maps played at LAN with a 1.17 rating. His K/D over that time was a 1.21, going positive Differential every tournament.</p>

<p>Aleksi 'allu' Jalli is the next most consistent player, averaging a 1.12 over the same span with a 1.19 K/D .</p>

<p class="subheading">What to Watch</p>

<p>This is a team that shows tremendous team play, capitalizing off of teammates' utility quite often. They have not disappointed since the major, and have the ability to hang in with almost any team in the game. The only team they have yet to truly prove themselves against is Vitality, whom they have lost two Bo3s to.</p>

<p>In Cologne they will be in Group B with Astralis, MIBR, Vitality, Heroic, NiP, fnatic, and BIG. While they should be the favorites in the first round as they face Heroic, the looming possibility of Astralis and Vitality as second round group opponents is sure to have their attention, and may cause them to overlook Heroic.</p>
