<p>Starting the second half of our previews, we have the current top team, Liquid. Since Katowice, Team Liquid has looked nearly unstoppable. They have won 3 of the required 4 tournaments of the Intel Grand Slam.</p>

<p class="subheading">Roster</p>

{% include teamlist.html logo="liquid" players="Nicholas 'nitr0' Cannella|Jonathan 'EliGE' Jablonowski|Russel 'Twistzz' Van Dulken|Keith 'NAF' Markovic|Jacky 'Stewie2K' Yip|Eric 'adreN' Hoag (Coach)" country="US|US|CA|CA|US|US" %}

<p class="subheading">Performance</p>

<p>They have attended BLAST Pro Series Sao Paulo(2nd) and Miami(2nd), IEM Sydney(1st), cs_summit 4(2nd), DreamHack Masters Dallas(1st), and ESL Pro League Season 9 Finals(1st).</p>

<p>At these events, Liquid has lost Bo3s to Astralis(BLAST Pro Sao Paulo), FaZe(BLAST Pro Miami), and Vitality(cs_summit). Meanwhile they have won Bo3s against BIG(IEM Sydney), NiP(IEM Sydney), MIBR(IEM Sydney, ESL Pro League Finals), NRG(cs_summit), North ( DH Masters Dallas), FaZe(DH Masters Dallas), FURIA(DH Masters Dallas), ENCE(DH Masters Dallas), TYLOO(ESL Pro League Finals), HellRaisers(ESL Pro League Finals), Astralis(ESL Pro League Finals), and mousesports(ESL Pro League Finals). They have also beaten G2 and fnatic in Bo5s at ESL Pro League Finals and IEM Sydney respectively.</p>

<p class="subheading">Important Stats</p>

<p>3 of 4 Intel Grand Slam wins with 7 remaining chances to win one more event for the million dollars.</p>

<p>Jonathan â€œEliGE' Jablonowski is the teams most consistently good player since the Major. He has had a 1.20 rating over the 69 maps they have played, including a 1.29 over 17 maps at ESL Pro League Finals, and a 1.24 over 11 maps at DreamHack Masters Dallas.</p>

<p class="subheading">What to Watch</p>

<p>Team play is again the name of the game for Liquid. They capitalize on friendly flashes and other utility at a rate seemingly much higher than most if not all of their competitors. If there is a team that looks like Liquid killers, it would be Vitality, a team that beat them on 4 of 4 maps at cs_summit.</p>

<p>The pressure of possibly closing out the Intel Grand Slam in Cologne could play a factor in their play at the event as well.</p>

<p>They were placed into Group A with NatusVincere, FaZe, FURIA, NRG, Renegades, mousesports, and MVP PK. The Korean squad of MVP PK is their first opponent, and they are in the opposite group from Astralis, Vitality and ENCE.</p>

<p>The only team to have beaten them since Katowice in their group in a best of 3 is FaZe Clan.</p>
