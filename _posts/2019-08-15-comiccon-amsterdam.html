<p>One of our writers, Grady, is heading over to Berlin to cover the StarLadder Berlin Counter-Strike Major. While he is over there, thanks to the awesome folks in the Netherlands, he is also going to attend Comic Con Amsterdam!</p>

<p class="subheading">What is Comic Con Amsterdam?</p>

<p>Comic Con Amsterdam covers a large amount of geek culture - ranging from television and movies, all the way to comics and gaming. You can meet stars from your favorite television shows, see some amazing cosplay, and visits hundreds of stalls.</p>

<p class="subheading">Did you say gaming?</p>

<p>Of course I did. Comic Con Amsterdam features a Gaming Zone that includes a bunch of games that are free-to-play, as well as some mini-tournaments for you to test your skill against other attendees. There will also be an abundance of retro gaming, allowing you to rediscover days past, with some consoles dating back over 20-30 years.</p>

<p class="subheading">What guests are attending?</p>
