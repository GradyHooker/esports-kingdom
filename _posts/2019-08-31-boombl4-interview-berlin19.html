<p>Natus Vincere just dispatched MIBR in an elimination match after shockingly dropping down to 1-2. We talk to Boombl4 about what went wrong in the early games, his feeling joining NaVi, and playing against teams from your own region.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Grady: Coming into the major, you had a couple of rough games go into overtime and ultimately fall the other way. What's NaVi taken from those losses?</p>
<p>Boombl4: We are fixing just our mistakes on the maps. It's feeling really bad, because you're 1-2 and you lost two best-of-ones. I feel like if we play best-of-free versus mousesports and G2, we can easily beat them. [The loses] were best-of-ones, so no one was tiled, we are just fixing our mistakes and preparing for the best-of-threes now. We are showing what we can do now, we beat MIBR 2-0 now, so I think we can do it tomorrow as well.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Those games were against teams that have come through the Challenges Stage. Do you think there's an advantage to already playing rather than coming in cold? </p>
<p>I don't think so, it's not a big advantage. You can come here early and play pracs if you are a new team, maybe jet-lag, but it's Germany - maybe for Americans, but for us I don't think so.</p>

<p class="interview-question">You've come into NaVi, how do you feel in the team?</p>
<p>When I got the invite from NaVi, I was really shocked. I was playing in WinStrike and we had the CIS Minor in one month and if I leave, I am the captain. I felt really bad because my team was without a captain at CIS Minor, but on the other side you can join the best team in CIS. I just did the right choice for me and went to the best team. I was feeling happy and nervous a little bit because it's a new chapter for me, a new role, new friends, new team - one month ago I was really nervous, but right now I'm feeling great.</p>

<p class="interview-question">You've gone up against other teams from the CIS region as well. Do you feel like you play against teams in that region better than you play against other teams?</p>
<p>When the same regions playing versus each other, like NRG against Liquid; it's a country-battle, a derby. It's the same for us, we were playing versus DreamEaters and we were feeling confident.</p>
<p>Manager Ugin: It's a bit tricky because they know how to play against us, but we feel that we are better and feel confident. We just play our game.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Alright, thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
