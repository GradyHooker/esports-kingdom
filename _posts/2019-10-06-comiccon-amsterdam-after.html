<p>In his recent trip to Europe, Grady took a stop in The Netherlands for Comic Con Amsterdam. In this article he shows you some of the photos he took form the event as well as letting you know about all of the cool things in the Dutch convention.</p>

<p>Comic Con Amsterdam had a large amount of stall selling all sorts of merchandise, ranging from t-shirt and posters all the way to classic video games. When you first enter the convention center you are greeted by an open-plan convention floor with similar stores grouped together that makes navigation easy as well as a huge area for resting and eating from the food carts.</p>

<p>My favorite store that I saw was just around the entrance and a hidden gem. Instead of the brand new pop vinyl figures or freshly printed clothing, this stall housed some relics from my past. It was selling VCR tapes of old television shows, classic Pokemon Trading Card sets, and retro video games from the last 20 years. I almost tempted many friends from back in New Zealand to purchase some of the stuff that we never see on our side of the world.</p>

<p>The events that probably drew the biggest crowds in the convention center were the celebrity panels. Stars like Manu Bennet, from Arrow and other shows, take the stage in front of the attendees and tell stories about their career, let people know how they got into the business, and take questions from the adoring fans. This is your chance to up close and personal with the celebs and ask any burning question you have for nothing more than the price of admission to the convention.</p>

<p>These celebrities were also signing autographs and taking professional photos with attendees for a fee. I look forward to see who Comic Con Amsterdam manages to pull in to attend next year.</p>

<p>Overall Comic Con Amsterdam was a worthwhile experience with a little bit for everyone. It has a massive amount of toys for the children (and kids at heart), collectibles from yesteryear for the adults, and specific fandom great for the die-hard fans of specific shows or anime.</p>
