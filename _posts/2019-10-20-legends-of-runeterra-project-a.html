<p>During their 10-year-anniversary celebration for League of Legends, Riot Games announced a massive amount of things including a fighting game, shooter game, card game, mobile versions of everything, and an anime. We are going to take a closer look at Legends of Runeterra, the card game, and Project A, the shooter game.</p>

<p class="subheading">Legends of Runeterra</p>

<p>Let's start off with the official description:</p>

<p class="quote">Legends of Runeterra is a free-to-play strategy card game set in the world of LoL. LoR features cards based on the iconic champions of LoL, as well as new characters and allies hailing from the regions of Runeterra, each with their own style and strategic advantage. LoR’s gameplay is built around dynamic, alternating combat that demands players use their skill, creativity, and cleverness to succeed. LoR offers players multiple options to acquire cards, including both robust free-to-play options and the ability to directly purchase any card with either earned or paid currency.</p>

<p>At PAX Australia, myself and a handful of other journalists actually got to go hands-on with Legends of Runeterra ahead of the announcement last week. I don't have a huge experience in digital card games other than the Pokemon TCG and Solitaire, but this game did manage to hook me. There was a bit of a learning curve as the first 2 games I spent getting my ass kicked, after that though I turned it around and won 6 games against the AI in a row.</p>

<p>There are a few features that set LoR apart from other games in it's genre - one of which is the "Oracle's Eye". By using this eye, you were able to see the predicted outcome of your move before you decided to commit to it. This meant that for newer players like myself, I could see what certain combinations would do, while the expert players can double-check their complicated maneuvers full of spells and abilities.</p>

<p>There was also a big emphasis on the fact that there would be no random packs. You can earn cards through in-game currency, exploring a region, or unlocking your weekly vault - all of which are triggered by playing the game. There will be purchases, but they will buy you tokens that you can redeem for exactly the game you want, not a pack that you will have to open 100 of to even get a chance of the card you need.</p>

<p>Overall Legends of Runeterra felt like a Hearthstone-like game, that has been heavily influenced by Magic the Gathering, with some unique features that only this game is bringing to the table.</p>

<p>Legends of Runeterra will launch in 2020 for both PC and mobile, and is open now for <a href="https://playruneterra.com/en-us/">pre-registration</a>.</p>

<p class="subheading">"Project A"</p>

<p>Once again, we will kick off with the official description:</p>

<p class="quote">"Project A" (temporary codename) is a stylish, competitive, character-based tactical shooter for PC currently in development at Riot Games. The game has a lethal cast of characters with abilities that create unique opportunities for your gunplay to shine, with a new, mature, more grounded IP that takes place on a near-future Earth.</p>

<p>From the small amount of video we have seen and tweets from Riot's VP of IP and Entertainment, Greg 'Ghostcrawler' Street we have a fair guess towards what the gameplay for "Project A" is going to be. It looks to be very much Counter-Strike in that you have a single life per round and are playing a slower round-by-round game about map control and utility usage. Some of the supernatural abilities we have seen have caused people to draw similarities with yet another Blizzard title, Overwatch, but it appears as though the abilities are to enhance the gunplay and are not the core functionality.</p>

<p>The best way I can describe it is Counter-Strike, but instead of grenades you have different heroes with different utility-based abilities. Whether we are correct or not is yet to be seen as we have only had glimpses of the game, but either way it has me excited. A new FPS game entering the esports scene can only be a good thing and Riot Games have a good track record when it comes to esports investment and tournaments - even if they are structured/ran very differently to Counter-Strike's.</p>

<p>Riot Games will be releasing more information about "Project A" in 2020 when the game is officially revealed.</p>
