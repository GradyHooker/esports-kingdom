<p>In the first part of the update that Valve pushed out today for Counter-Strike, we see the new version of Cache become more widely available, three new maps enter the game, and the highly requested nerf for the SG553 (with some extra unexpected buffs).</p>

<p class="subheading">Weapon Nerfs/Buffs</p>

<p>A change that has been requested by the professional players as well as the Counter-Strike community was to make the SG553 more expensive and Valve have done just that. The SG553 now costs $3000 and the reasoning Valve provided was "to bring its price more in line with its value".</p>

<p>This isn't the only gun change that they have made in this update as they continue to try and make a larger variety of guns viable in competitive play. The FAMAS and Galil both got buffs with their price being reduced down to $2050 and $1800 respectively (down $200 form their original values). Both guns have also had their full-auto spray accuracy improved.</p>

<p class="subheading">New Maps</p>

<p>The new version of Cache has been moved from Scrimmage to Competitive Matchmaking and two other maps (Zoo and Seaside) have been removed from all gamemodes.</p>

<p>There is also 3 new maps that have been added to the game in this update; Studio, Jungle, and Lunacy.</p>

<p>Added Studio to Scrimmage and Casual Sigma map groups.</p>
