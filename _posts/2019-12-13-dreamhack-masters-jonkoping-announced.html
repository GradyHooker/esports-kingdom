They will be fighting it out for a prizepool of $250,000 as well as points towards the ESL Pro Tour's Road to Cologne.</p>

<p>A quick comment from Marcus Lindmark, co-CEO at DreamHack</p>

{% include quote.html text="Bringing DreamHack Masters to Jönköping really highlights a historic significance. As DreamHack grew, so did our need for space to accommodate that expansion - resulting in what we now know as DreamHack Masters today, generally standalone tournaments taking place at arenas separated from our festivals. To bring everything we are back to where it really all began at our DreamHack festival in Jönköping is tremendous."%}

<p>Jönköping in Sweden has hosted a bunch of DreamHack Summer and Winter tournaments during the Counter-Strike past, including the first and fourth Valve Majors.</p>

<li>DreamHack Winter 2013 (First Valve Major)</li>

<li>DreamHack Winter 2014 (Fourth Valve Major)</li>

<p>And Sweden isn't unfamiliar with the DreamHack Masters banner either, having hosted the events for the last four years:</p>

<li>DreamHack Masters Malmö 2016</li>

<li>DreamHack Masters Malmö 2017</li>

<li>DreamHack Masters Stockholm 2018</li>

<li>DreamHack Masters Malmö 2019</li>
