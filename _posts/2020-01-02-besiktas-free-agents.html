<p>Juliano kicked off 2020 with an announcement that her team would no longer be representing Beşiktaş Esports and are now free agents with no contract. This wasn't the only announcement as she also let us know that mimi from Copenhagen Flames Fe would be joining them.</p>

<p>Beşiktaş Esports signed the former RES Gaming roster in July 2018 and have cemented themselves as a top 5 female Counter-Strike team with playoff performances in Intel Challenge Katowice, Copenhagen Games 2019 (Female), and DreamHack Showdown Valencia 2019.</p>

<p>Recently in October, Missa left the team and Beşiktaş were playing with stand-ins such as blackie, tweNty, and c0wgirl. The decision to bring mimi in might be fueled by the success that juliano, zAAz, and mimi had during 2016-2017 under the Team Secret and Dynasty Gaming Female banners.</p>

<p>mimi added some context with her own tweet on the roster move:</p>
