<p>The following article is unconfirmed and the combination of facts and observations. Following on from the fact that Hatz has left, possibly for Renegades (see our other article), that leaves an empty spot on ORDER that needs to be filled.</p>

<p class="subheading">Hatz leaving ORDER</p>

<p>We covered Hatz leaving ORDER and probably joining Renegades <a href="https://esportskingdom.gg/counter-strike/2020-01-unconfirmed-renegades-hatz">in our last article</a>.</p>

<p class="subheading">ORDER ESEA Roster</p>

<p>We came about this information in a very similar way to the Renegades Hatz move, it came from ESEA roster pages. ESEA rosters have been a pretty credible source for previous roster leaks as teams get set up for the next season.</p>

{% include image.html image="unconfirmed-order-rickeh-esea" caption="Screenshot of the ORDER ESEA roster page" %}

<p>This shows that Rickeh was added to the ORDER roster on the same day as Hatz was moved over to Renegades. It is possible that ESEA have a roster-lock that forced the premature roster moves that they have not announced yet. This isn't confirmation in any way, but it is a pretty good indication.</p>

<p>This would be the first professional team that Rickeh has played on since the StarLadder Major in berlin all the way back in September 2019. This event is where Complexity Gaming bombed out in 20th-22nd and caused the entire rebuild of the roster.</p>

<p>If this move is confirmed, the ORDER roster would consist of:</p>

{% include teamlist.html logo="order-2018" players="Chris 'emagine' Rowland|Alistair 'aliStair' Johnston|Matthew 'Valiance' Hartrick|Karlo 'USTILO' Pivac|Ricky 'Rickeh' Mulholland" country="AU|AU|AU|AU|AU" %}

<p class="subheading">Australia is burning</p>

<p>This last part isn't esports, but it is very important.</p>

<p>If you don't know by now, Australia is currently on fire and in need of help. <a href="https://twitter.com/alyciamrgan">@alyciamrgan on Twitter</a> compiled a list of charities that are helping the firefighters, wildlife, and people affected by these fires, I have incldued all of the links below.
