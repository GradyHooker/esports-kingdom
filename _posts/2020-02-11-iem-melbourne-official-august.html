<p class="subheading">General Info</p>

<p>The Melbourne Esports Open, in conjunction with Intel Extreme Masters, will be held at Melbourne & Olympic Parks across Saturday 22 and Sunday 23 August, 2020.</p>

<p>IEM Melbourne 2020, <a href="/counter-strike/2019-12-entire-esl-pro-tour">as predicted by Esports Kingdom</a> will be a Masters-level tournament in the ESL Pro Tour. This connects it to all of the other ESL and DreamHack tournaments throughout the year in offering a US$1 million prize as a part of the Intel Grand Slam for any team to win four Masters-level tournaments inside the span of ten events.</p>

<p>As always, IEM Melbourne 2020 will also be offering signing sessions to allow the fans to get face-to-face with their favorite players and get some autographs. There will also be giveaways from partners and sponsors at the IEM Expo - which will also feature the latest PC and VR games, all powered by Intel’s leading gaming technology.</p>

<p>ESL Vice President Pro Gaming Michal "CARMAC" Blicharz talked about Australian events:</p>

{% include quote.html text="Australian Counter-Strike fans are second to none, and when we had the opportunity to bring IEM to Melbourne, to headline the Melbourne Esports Open, it was a perfect fit. Australians have always generated atmospheres that could not be matched by anything else. Coming back for 2020 was a top priority, and the Melbourne Esports Open was a natural match. It will open Intel Extreme Masters to a broader audience and provide CSGO fans a richer event experience" %} 

<p>Intel® Managing Director Sales and Marketing Group, Asia Pacific and Japan Territory, Santhosh Viswanathan said:</p>

{% include quote.html text="We're excited for IEM to headline the Melbourne Esports Open. By bringing these two events together, we're taking what was already Australia's biggest esports weekend in IEM and making it an even bigger spectacle for fans. We're also looking forward to showcasing Intel's gaming ecosystem of products that top esports leagues use to deliver a world-class experience to gamers as well as the gaming community." %}
