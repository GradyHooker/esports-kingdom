<p>We are roughly halfway through most of the Spring seasons in the League of Legends leagues. So it is time for Ryan and Grady to get together once again and try to collate all of the teams together into a tier rankings. Unfortunately because of the lack of play, we have had to skip LPL for this edition.</p>

<p>Tier Rankings compiled by Ryan "Hullitude" Hull (<a href="https://twitter.com/Hullitude">@Hulltude on Twitter</a>) and Grady Hooker (<a href="https://twitter.com/GradyHooker">@GradyHooker on Twitter</a>).</p>

<p>NOTE: Teams from the LoL Pro League (LPL) have been excluded from these tier rankings based in the low amount of games played due to the current Coronavirus problem in China.</p>
