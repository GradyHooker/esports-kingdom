<p>After an abysmal last place finish in Season 8 of the Rocket League Championship, G2 Esports have turned it all around. They captured the Season 9 victory and just now captured the Spring Series win after a flawless 4-0 grand final against NRG.</p>

<p>The Rocket League Spring Series is a set of tournaments for each region (North America, South America, Europe, and Oceania) where the top 4 teams from Season 9 will be joined by 4 teams from open qualifiers in a double elimination bracket. The teams in the North American tournament were:</p>

<p>November last year G2 Esports ended Season 8 in last place and scraped through relegation to land a spot in Season 9. Without changing a single player, G2 Esports entered Season 9 hot out of the gate and won their first 5 weeks of play. In the playoffs they went 4-3 against NRG Esports (Semifinals) and 4-0 against Spacestation Gaming (Grand Finals) to complete the biggest turnaround in Rocket League esports. From dead last to first place in 4 months, but could the dream continue?</p>

<p>In the Rocket League Spring Series, the first opponent up for G2 Esports was Rogue, who they took out 3-0 without dropping a single game. Then it was Team Envy who, thanks to an overtime goal, managed to grab one game off of G2, but ultimately still fell 3-1.</p>

<p>Moving into the Winners Final it would be a replay of the Season 9 Semifinal between G2 Esports and NRG Esports in a best-of-seven series. NRG looked to be the stronger team capturing the first two games (3-0 and 5-1), but then G2 started to claw back into contention - not wanting to lose the Spring Series championship. G2 then proceeded to win four straight games by a one-point lead to advance to the Grand Finals.</p>

<p>Eventually in the Losers Final, NRG Esports would out-class Rogue to set up a rematch in the Grand Finals between G2 Esports and NRG once again. This time G2 shut down NRG from the start and with their one-game advantage from the upper bracket they managed to post a series score of 3-0, leaving them one win away from championship gold.</p>

<p>Game 4 saw G2 being relentless on the offensive and never letting NRG take a breath. The only score was JKnaps on the two-minute mark after the ball was left still right next to the goal. This meant that G2 Esports were able to close out the Grand Final with a flawless series score of 4-0 and are your North American Rocket League Spring Series champions!</p>
