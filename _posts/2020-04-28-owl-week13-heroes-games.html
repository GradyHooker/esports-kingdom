<p>Blizzard have now announced the 4 heroes who will be banned during Week 13 play in their Overwatch League. We also know what the 10 match-ups will be for the week and exactly what times you can catch them live.</p>

<p class="subheading">Hero Bans</p>

{% include tweet.html tweet="1254564362267885571" %}

<p>Hero pools are an algorithm-driven way to figure out which heroes are being played the most and remove them from play for the next week. There is an element of randomness, but heroes with a higher play-rate will have a higher chance of being banned. There is one exception and that is if a hero was banned last week, they cannot be banned again the next week.</p>

<p>The four heroes that will be banned for Week 13 play are:</p>

<li>Damage: McCree & Widowmaker</li>

<li>Tank: Wrecking Ball</li>

<li>Support: Mercy</li>

<p>For last week (Week 12) the banned heroes were Tracer & Echo (Damage), Orisa (Tank), and Moira (Support).</p>
