<p>The coach of 100 Thieves' Counter-Strike roster, kassad, has left the organisation after being with the Australian squad since 2017. kassad has released a statement and listed his reasons for departing 100 Thieves and leaving the boys coach-less. </p>

<p>When the team of AZR, jks, jkaem, Liazz, and Gratisfaction were still under the Renegades banner - they were in need for a coach. In October of 2018, Renegades announced that they had signed Serbian coach kassad to once again join their ranks. kassad had previously coached for Renegades in 2017, but left for four months to coach Valiance.</p>

<p>100 Thieves said that the agreement to part ways with kassad was a mutual decision. kassad had done good work the roster and together they have reached the <a href='https://esportskingdom.gg/tier-rankings/csgo'>B-Tier of our Counter-Strike Tier Rankings</a> and shown themselves to be a powerhouse in the North American region.</p>

<p>In his statement, kassad mentioned that the team and himself had been drifting apart for awhile now. He wasn't happy with the stagnation and lack of progress this year. kassad also confirms what 100 Thieves said by mentioning that there is no bad blood between the team and himself, but merely that their visions didn't align.</p>

<p>This will leave 100 Thieves without a coach into into the Road to Rio North American competition that they are currently competing in. 100 Thieves current win record in the Road to Rio tournament is 3-1 with just Cloud9 left to play in the group stages.</p>

<p>The current 100 Thieves roster is:</p>
