<p>Pentanet.GG narrowly missed out on a playoffs spot in the Oceanic Pro League Split 1 with a 6th place finish. Today that announced that they are making rosters changes with one player heading to the bench and a new one coming on over from Gravitas.</p>

<p>The five players that play under the Pentanet.GG banner were <a href='/league-of-legends/2020-01-pentanetgg-signs-opl-team'>signed back in January of this year</a>. Since then they have played together in the Oceanic Pro League Split 1 and placed a respectable 6th - but it is time for a change.</p>

<p>Pentanet.GG will be moving Paris "Souli" Sitzoukis to the bench and allowing him the freedom of exploring all available options.</p>

<p>Pete Curulli, General Manager of Pentanet.GG, talked about the addition of Pabu:</p>
<p class="quote">Souli is a charismatic, passionate, and talented OPL player. He is giving his future with Pentanet.GG some thought, and we will continue to support his professional development by establishing the appropriate LoL and content coaching around him until such time as he makes a decision.</p>
<p class="quote">It is a balance between what we can provide and where he personally wants to take his career, so if Souli decides to chase opportunities elsewhere we will support the decision, but my hope is that he stays and continues to make the most of what we can offer.</p>

<p>To replace Souli, the Pentanet.GG organisation have picked up Jackson "Pabu" Pavone, who had played Split 1 of the Oceanic Pro League season this year with the Gravitas organisation.</p>

<p>Pete Curullialso talked about the addition of Pabu:</p>
<p class="quote">As we continue to grow as an organisation and evolve not just our pathway but also the definition of what we stand for, I'm really excited to welcome Pabu into the organisation. His performances throughout split one impressed us and I look forward to the energy he'll bring to the team.</p>

<p>Pabu typically played in the Top Lane role, but Pentanet.GG will be using him as their starting Jungler.</p>

<p>Jackson "Pabu" Pavone commented on the role change and joining Pentanet.GG:</p>
<p class="quote">I'm super keen to finally play a role with so much influence over the game. The team is super talented and I'm hoping I can bring them the direction and confidence to take them to the next level. It's going to be embarrassing when players who have been playing this role for almost a  decade get rolled over by me.</p>

<p>The Pentanet.GG roster competing in the OPL Split 2 is:</p>
{% include teamlist.html logo="pentanet" players="Brandon 'BioPanther' Alexander (Top)|Jarod 'getback' Tucker (Mid)|Jackson 'Pabu' Pavone (Jungle)|Mark 'Praedyth' Lewis (ADC)|Jake 'Rogue' Sharwood (Support)" country="AU|AU|AU|AU|AU" %}

<p>Pentanet.GG will return to action in the Oceanic Pro League Split 2 later in the year.</p>
