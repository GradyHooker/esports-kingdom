<p>San Francisco Shock player sinatraa shocked the esports world today by announcing that they retiring from professional Overwatch and is heading for brand new pastures of VALORANT. sinatraa was the MVP of Season 2 of the Overwatch League where The Shock won the championship.</p>

<p>sinatraa was an original member of the San Francisco Shock, signed in 2017 when he was still under the age limit to play in the Overwatch League. The Shock were so confident in the young player that they waited for him to become of age and then immediately placed him on the starting roster.</p>

<p>In 2019 during the 2nd Season of the Overwatch League, San Francisco Shock went 23-5 in the Pacific Division and landed themselves a top seed position in the playoffs. After a small road-bump in their opening match-up, they beat five of the top teams 4-0 one after another on their way to claim the championship trophy.</p>
