<p>Bind</p>
<li>Updated materials to make surfaces more consistent overall</li>

<p class="subheading">HUD & UI</p>
<li>New directional damage indicator visual</li>
<li>New low health and low ammo visuals</li>
<li>Removed character portrait from player's minimap icon to better distinguish player icon; icon will receive additional color and polish in the future</li>
<li>Voice activity is now shown above allies' heads</li>
<li>Added color to spike icon above ally's head to make it easier to see</li>

<p class="subheading">Quality of Life</p>
<li>Added the ability to abandon a multiplayer Custom Game. Using the "Leave match" button in the ESC menu will allow you to permanently leave the match without penalty. Leaving the custom game in any other way (exit client, alt+f4, etc.) will still allow you to return to the match</li>

<li>Players who abandon matchmade games, or dodge agent selects, will now experience penalties that prevent them from queuing for a period of time. Frequent offenders will experience higher queue time penalties. Leaving ruins the match for everyone else, and should only be a last resort</li>
<li>Enabled the ability to see VALORANT players online in Riot games</li>
<li>Adjusted play flow UX moving queue buttons into lobby screens</li>
<li>Adjusted social panel UX to accommodate additional space</li>

<li>For all shotguns, moved the crosshair's center dot by 1px to center it on the screen</li>
