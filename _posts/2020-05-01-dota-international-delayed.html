<p>Valve just announced that due to the current COVID-19 pandemic that is sweeping across the esports world, the Dota 2 event 'The International' is going to be delayed. What will happen with the Battle Pass, prize-pool, and when will it be delayed until?</p>

<p>To read the original blog post, <a href='http://blog.dota2.com/2020/04/the-international-2/'>click here</a>.</p>

<p>Valve opened up with a comment about the event being delayed and then talked about possible dates that it will be delayed until:</p>

{% include quote.html text="We have been exploring various date possibilities, but it is likely that the event will need to happen in 2021. Given the highly volatile landscape for local gathering restrictions, virus trajectory, and global travel policies, we don't expect to have enough confidence to communicate firm dates in the near future."%}

<p>This does mean that the Dota Pro Circuit season that is coming up will need to be restructured and Valve hope to give more information on this in the future.</p>

<p>They also states that the Battle Pass will be coming out as planned this year, possibly a bit later, and it will still feed into the prize pool for the 10th International.</p>

{% include quote.html text="The 10th International prize pool will be funded by 25% of sales of the next Battle Pass, which we are planning to release soon instead of closer to the event itself. However, with our team working from home and things taking longer to complete, the release date of the Battle Pass will be at least a couple of weeks later than usual."%}

<p>We will endeavor to publish more updates as Valve announces them with regards to dates around the delay and the Battle Pass.</p>
