<p>There was only four teams playing in the Oceania division on the Road to Rio, but that doesn't mean the competition wasn't strong. We know which team advances straight into the Grand Finals and which two have to fight once more for the other slot.</p>

<p>For current betting odds for the Road to Rio Oceania matches - check out <a href="https://esportsbettingtop.com/csgo-betting-odds/esl-one-road-to-rio-oceania/">esportsbettingtop.com</a>.</p>

{% include logoheadline.html logo="renegades" headline="Renegeades (1st in Group Stage)" %} 
<p>The Renegades hadn't had an official game since March when they swept the Oceanic Closed Qualifier for the, at the time, Rio Major. That didn't slow them down at all in the Group Stages as they didn't drop a single map and 2-0-d every other team. This team is your favorites to win it all and they are also <a href="/counter-strike/2020-04-csgo-tiers-epl11-flashpoint1">the only team in A-Tier for the Asia-Pacific region in our CSGO Tier Rankings</a>.</p>

{% include logoheadline.html logo="order-2018" headline="ORDER (2nd in Group Stage)" %} 
<p>These guys have had a good 2020 so far; they came second in Rio Major Oceanic Closed Qualifier (losing to Renegades and beating Chiefs), they came second in the ESL ANZ Champs Season 10 (losing to AVANT), and they took out first place in MDL Australia Season 33 with a near flawless record (only losing to AVANT). Since AVANT are not in this competition, ORDER can run wild without their kryptonite.</p>

{% include logoheadline.html logo="chiefs" headline="Chiefs ESC (3rd in Group Stage)" %} 
<p>In February, Chiefs Esports Club picked up the ex-Genuine Gaming roster lead by apocdud and then later on signed yam to be the coach. Since the acquisition the team has failed to find their footing with some less-than-stellar finishes in MDL Australia and ESL ANZ Champs. Do not count them out, they are still a strong team and could cause an upset in the playoffs.</p>

<p class="subheading">Semifinal Match-up</p>

{% include team-info.html logo="order-2018" logo2="chiefs" text="" %}
<p>The winner of this match-up goes on to face Renegades in the Grand Finals. ORDER placed higher and just beat Chiefs in the Group Stages 2-1 (10-16, 16-9, 16-11) so they have the edge. Jumping over to <a href="https://esportsbettingtop.com/csgo-betting-odds/esl-one-road-to-rio-oceania/">esportsbettingtop.com</a> we see that the betting odds are heavily favoring ORDER, with an average 1.30 odds (at time of writing). I think we are going to see a rematch between ORDER and Renegades in the grand final - which should be a fitting end to this tournament.</p>
