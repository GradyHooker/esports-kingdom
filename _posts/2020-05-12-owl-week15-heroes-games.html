<p>It is yet again another week in the OverWatch League and that means that we have a brand new set of Hero Bans and Match-ups for you. Come and see which heroes will not be appearing this week and what time your favorite teams will face off.</p>

<p class="subheading">Hero Bans</p>

{% include tweet.html tweet="1259654430682726400" %}

<p>Hero pools are an algorithm-driven way to figure out which heroes are being played the most and remove them from play for the next week. There is an element of randomness, but heroes with a higher play-rate will have a higher chance of being banned. There is one exception and that is if a hero was banned last week, they cannot be banned again the next week.</p>

<p>The four heroes that will be banned for Week 15 play are:</p>

<li>Damage: Mei & Tracer</li>

<li>Tank: Orisa</li>

<li>Support: Moira</li>

<p>For last week (Week 14) the banned heroes were Reaper & Ashe (Damage), Reinhardt (Tank), and Brigitte (Support).</p>
