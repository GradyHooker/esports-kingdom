<p>Starting on June 22, teams from across the 10 competing SEA nations will go head-to-head in three different games, to prepare for the Southeast Asian Games next year, thank to Razer's Southeast Asian Invitational 2020 tournament.</p>

<p>The Razer Southeast Asian Invitational 2020 will be hosted in partnership with Tier One Entertainment, who are one of the largest gaming and esports talent agencies in Southeast Asia. Tier One are at the helm for talent promotions and the broadcast of the tournament.</p>

<p>Tryke Gutierrez, CEO of Tier One Entertainment, commented on the SEA Invitational 2020</p>
<p class="quote">We are excited to partner with a company such as Razer to create a platform for talents to shine. As a premiere talent agency in Southeast Asia, we want to lead initiatives like the SEA Invitational to help develop talents to become Truly Top Tier.</p>

<p class="subheading">The Games</p>

<p>The first of three games that will be featured at the Razer Southeast Asian Invitational 2020 is Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (MLBB). Mobile Legends was seen at the SEA Games last year where the Philippines grasped victory and the gold medal after beating Indonesia 3-2 in the finals.</p>
<p class="quote">Two teams of five players move around the map to kill enemies and monsters, gaining resources in the form of experience and gold to increase their character’s abilities and strength to eventually destroy their opponents' towers.</p>

<p>Secondly we have the mobile-version of the first competitive battle royale game, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. This will be the debut of PUBG in this sort of competition and will host a brand new set of competitors.</p>
<p class="quote">PUBG Mobile, as its name suggests, is played on the mobile phone. It is a shooter game in which up to one hundred players fight in a battle royale, where players fight to remain the last man standing.</p>

<p>The third and final game in the line-up will be DOTA 2. DOTA 2 has been around for a long time and the competitive scene is thriving around the world. Last year in the SEA Games the grand finals came down to the Philippines and Thailand - with the Philippines clinching the win.</p>
<p class="quote">Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game in which two teams each consisting of five players try to destroy a large structure known as the “Ancient” within the enemy's base.</p>
