<p>After the announcement of the Razer Southeast Asian Invitational 2020 Grady got some time to talk to David Tse, the Global Esports Director at Razer, about what is in Razer's esports future, the games they chose, and how the current situation helps/hinders esports.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Grady: The Razer SEA Invitational 2020 will feature PUBG Mobile, Dota 2, and MLBB - was there any other games considered for inclusion?</p>
<p>David Tse: We keep an open mind when it comes to explore opportunities with publishing partners. To maximize our audience, reach for the SEA-Invitational online, we primarily considered games based on the audience size of their communities in SEA region, and also the readiness of the esports federations to conduct the necessary qualifiers in their respective countries.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Two of the three games included are for the mobile platform, do you think that mobile is the future of esports?</p>
<p>Currently, the largest esports games are still on the PC platform, but I believe that the mobile platform will have the highest growth, especially in Asia. Games like PUBGM and MLBB have experienced some of the highest growths in both players and audiences. With the proliferation of mobile devices and accessories, which enhance mobile gaming experiences, mobile could be the most inclusive platform for esports in the future.</p>

<p class="interview-question">With esports moving towards online competitions, do you think this will hurt or help the competitive scene in the long run?</p>
<p>It will definitely help in the competitive scene of esports across borders. Online streaming tournaments is the very heart of esports as a form of entertainment and one of important pillars contributing to the success of esports tournaments. There will, however, still be challenges regarding latency or even the current model of tournament organization. But I believe the online structure and tournament capability will evolve to be more streamlined for players and interactive with the audiences.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Do you think that esports will be featured again at the Southeast Asian Games next year?</p>
<p>The inclusion of esports at the 31st SEA Games has not been announced yet, but we are very hopeful that it will be included again. The large participation of esports from the SEA countries, the great representation by the local esports federations, along with amazing viewership of esports events will be contributing factors.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Last year the Philippines gold medaled in 3 games (2 of which are features in the Razer SEA Invitational 2020) - do you think they can continue the SEA dominance?</p>
<p>With the success of the 30th SEA Games esports event last year, I believe it has created great momentum for many countries in SEA region. This was accomplished through the great efforts from the esports federations, who continue developing new talents and building up the capabilities of their national teams. SEA-Invitational will be a great training platform for all participating countries to test their readiness and learn from other competing teams. It is anyone's game to win.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Razer have been involved with esports for a long time, can we expect more from Razer in the coming months?</p>
<p>Razer's leadership in esports cuts across players and tournaments at a global level. Our Team Razer consists of 10 top professional teams competing in top esports games around the world, representing the best performance through our Razer gear. Aside from our sponsored professional esports teams, we are also committed to the development of esports athletes at different levels, along with providing them with the opportunity to compete.</p>
<p>We have a vision to establish esports in Olympics Games and making it the most inclusive sports on the world stage. With the success of the 30th SEA Games esports event last year, you can definitely expect more exciting news in the coming months and years.</p>
