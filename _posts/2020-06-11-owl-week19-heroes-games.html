<p>The Overwatch league is back with Week 19 and it's Summer Showdown. We had just wrapped May Melee and then took a few weeks off to allow for the teams to rest and now it is time for a return. We have all the details about Week 19 right here!</p>

<p class="subheading">Hero Bans</p>

{% include tweet.html tweet="1270762655574188033" %}

<p>Hero pools are an algorithm-driven way to figure out which heroes are being played the most and remove them from play for the next week. There is an element of randomness, but heroes with a higher play-rate will have a higher chance of being banned. There is one exception and that is if a hero was banned last week, they cannot be banned again the next week.</p>

<p>The four heroes that will be banned for Week 19 play are:</p>

<li>Damage: Echo & Sombra</li>

<li>Tank: D.Va</li>

<li>Support: Brigette</li>

<p>There were no bans last week as Overwatch League took the last two weeks off from competitive play.</p>
