<p>The hero bans for Week 20 of the Overwatch League might be very familiar, but the 13 huge match-ups we have this week are brand new and we have the time-converted start times for you!</p>

<p class="subheading">Hero Bans</p>

{% include tweet.html tweet="1274411907764682754" %}

<p>Hero pools are an algorithm-driven way to figure out which heroes are being played the most and remove them from play for the next week. There is an element of randomness, but heroes with a higher play-rate will have a higher chance of being banned. There is one exception and that is if a hero was banned last week, they cannot be banned again the next week.</p>

<p>The four heroes that will be banned for Week 20 play are the same as Week 19:</p>

<li>Damage: Echo & Sombra</li>

<li>Tank: D.Va</li>

<li>Support: Brigette</li>
