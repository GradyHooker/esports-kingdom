<p>Overwatch League has changed it's format a little with the lack of a hero pool this week. They will also be missing a hero pool during the Summer Showdown next week. Other than the hero pools, we do have all of the details around what games to expect this week!</p>

<p class="subheading">Hero Bans</p>

<p>Overwatch League Week 19 and 20 shared a hero pool, but Week 21 and the Summer Showdown tournament weekend will not feature hero pools at all. The next tournament that we get after Summer Showdown will also feature the same structure with the first two weeks sharing a hero pool and then the final week and tournament weekend have no hero pool.</p>
