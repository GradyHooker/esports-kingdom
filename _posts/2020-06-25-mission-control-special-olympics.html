<p>Mission Control, a rec league gaming platform that allows workplaces, community centers, and college clubs to conduct their own esports leagues, announced today a partnership with Special Olympics New York and Oregon, in which athletes will use the Mission Control platform to compete in leagues playing Rocket League.</p>

<p>Using the Mission Control platform, athletes have the ability to safely gather and connect through a shared interest in esports; as the company will create custom solutions to make the competitions more accessible for all athletes, while keeping them engaged through digital communities.</p>

<p>Austin Smith, CEO and founder of Mission Control, stated:</p>
<p class="quote">Our mission is to gather and grow communities. Through this integration, we're thrilled to be able to provide an accessible opportunity for Special Olympics Unified Sports athletes to build interpersonal relationships and thrive together through shared passions for gaming and healthy competition.</p>

<p>Through the collaboration, Special Olympics athletes participating in New York and Oregon will have the opportunity to compete in online Rocket League tournaments, either through "1v1" (one versus one; or two players competing against each other) or "2v2" (two teams of two players each competing against each other). Promoting social inclusion, friendship, and
understanding, the Rocket League 2v2 teams will each be representative of Special Olympics Unified Sports®, joining people with and without intellectual disabilities on the same team.</p>

<p>Stacey Hengsterman, president & CEO of Special Olympics New York said:</p>
<p class="quote">Our athletes cannot wait to jump into the esports world of competition, and we are proud to deliver them the opportunity in partnership with Mission Control, a company at the top of its game. Rocket League is going to bring our Unified Sports program to the next level, not only now while athletes are unable to compete in person but for the long-term. I can see this growing into a powerful new way for our athletes to stay connected with one another in the off-seasons for years to come.</p>

<p class="subheading">About Mission Control</p>
<p>Mission Control is a platform for recreational league esports, similar to a local adult softball league or college intramurals — but for video games. Mission Control manages the league schedule, validates scores, and determines the champion while also serving as a community forum for league members and friends. Gamers join Mission Control leagues (hosted by local and national organizations) for a casual, social experience doing something they love with their community. Organizations — whether a community group, college, LAN Center, or something else — can use Mission Control to gather a following, host leagues of various game titles, and manage their esports’ operations.</p>
