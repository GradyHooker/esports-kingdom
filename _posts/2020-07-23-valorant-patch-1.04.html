<p>This week we get a brand new patch for VALORANT with changes for a number of heroes, the biggest of which will affect Viper and Brimstone mains who will have to adjust their playstyle a little. The weapons get a little bit of love as well with changes for the Classic.</p>

<p>For the full list of updates included in VALORANT Patch 1.04 <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/news/game-updates/valorant-patch-notes-1-04/">click here</a>.</p>

<p class="subheading">Agent updates</p>

{% include logoheadline.html logo="valorant-viper" headline="Viper" size="tiny" notBold="false" %}
<p class="bold">Viper's Pit</p>
<ul>
<li>Max time outside of her ultimate before it collapses changed from 5 to 15 seconds</li>
<li>She can hold the ability to drop her ultimate early</li>
<li>Enemies now have their minimap obscured (like when Omen uses his ultimate) while they're inside Viper's Pit and do not provide minimap detection for their allies</li>
<li>Increased the colour glow at the edge of Viper's near-sight</li>
</ul>
<p>This update will make Viper's ultimate ability stronger without making it a straight up unfair fight. With the lack of minimap to pinpoint her location inside the Viper's Pit team communication will be required to tackle it. In terms of the pro scene, nothing will change in this aspect but during a pug, playing viper and playing around your ultimate to out play your opposition should be easier and feel more rewarding. There's nothing more annoying than planting your ultimate and leaving it for more than five seconds and losing it. Now with the timer changed to 15 seconds, it gives viper players more avenues of choice to keep the other team on their toes.</p>

<p class="bold">Decay</p>
<ul>
<li>Viper's decay on enemies per second increased from 10 to 15 on all sources. (Her Ultimate, Smoke, and Wall)</li>
<li>After exiting Viper's abilities above, enemy decay sustains for 2.5 seconds before starting to fade instead of instantly gaining the health back</li>
</ul>
<p>With this change, all of Viper's vision blocking abilities become more dangerous to push as the lost health isn't gained back as quickly, giving Viper and her team a wider time to capitalize on her abilities.</p>

<p class="bold">Fuel</p>
<ul>
<li>Having both Poison Cloud and Toxic Screen active at the same time doesn't consume additional fuel any more. Having either one or both active at the same time costs the same amount of fuel</li>
</ul>
<p>This change gives viper players more freedom with her kit to use how they like. Whether defending a site or attacking, giving her twice as many options as before. Such as using Poison Cloud on the site she is defending, while shooting Toxic Screen over to the other site to help out there at the same time.</p>

{% include logoheadline.html logo="valorant-raze" headline="Raze" size="tiny" notBold="false" %}
<p class="bold">Showstopper</p>
<ul>
<li>Ultimate cost changed from 6 to 7 points</li>
</ul>
<p>The developers for VALORANT, through collecting a lot of data from games played have noticed that Raze's ultimate is one of the most impactful in the game and almost useful in any situation. As a result of this, they're increasing the cost by 1. This should reduce how often Showstopper could potentially impact the game.</p>

{% include logoheadline.html logo="valorant-brimstone" headline="Brimstone" size="tiny" notBold="false" %}
<p class="bold">Orbital Strike</p>
<ul>
<li>Ultimate cost changed from 6 to 7 points</li>
</ul>
<p>As with Raze's Showstopper, Brimstone's ultimate was very impactful and useful in a wide variety of situations and doing so a little too frequently.</p>

<p class="bold">Stim Beacon</p>
<ul>
<li>No longer buffs enemies</li>
<li>No longer shows it's radius of effect to enemies</li>
</ul>
<p>A small change that has some interesting implications on the game. You can no longer bait your opposition by throwing it in a corner you're not in. But now you can place it down, and if by chance, the opposition doesn't hear the sound queue of the beacon being dropped you have the potential to catch them off guard without giving your position away, especially when defending the spike.</p>

{% include logoheadline.html logo="valorant-cypher" headline="Cypher" size="tiny" notBold="false" %}
<p class="bold">Cyber Cage</p>
<ul>
<li>Can now be picked up during the buy phase</li>
</ul>
<p>This change is a great addition to the game. I personally don't know how many times I've pushed Q and thrown away a $200 cage by accident.</p>

<p class="subheading">Weapon Updates</p>
<p class="bold">Classic</p>
<p>The classic has received a small update due to a bug where the right click burst didn't have any inaccuracy penalty while jumping. Which will be fixed as of patch 1.04.</p>
<p>They also added a 10% bonus to accuracy when crouching and stationary, as the intent is to feel consistent with crouch providing an accuracy benefit.</p>
