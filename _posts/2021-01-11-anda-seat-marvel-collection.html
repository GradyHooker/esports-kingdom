<p class="subheading">Chair Details</p>

<p>Anda Seat has invested in human engineering for over 10 years and created the AD design. The AD design applies the science of ergonomics, to maximise healthy seated hours by reducing fatigue and discomfort. AD design significantly improves the sitting health for gamers, office workers and people sitting on chairs anytime, anywhere.</p>

<p>The AD Plus PVC leather (Captain America, Iron Man, Ant-Man) and AD Alpha Linen Fabric (Spider-Man) is used on these high-end Anda Seat chairs, offering scratch and stain resistant, smooth, bonded PVC leather. The high quality material was designed and made with total comfort in mind. Not only is it easy to clean, but it will ensure the chair stays in its original shape. AD materials do not contain any harmful elements, perfect for adults and kids.</p>

<p>Padded with 65Kg/M3 (Iron Man is 60Kg, Ant-Man 55Kg) cold-cured and super high-density foam, the Anda Seat Marvel gaming chairs offer the all-important support for the spine during long gaming sessions, providing excellent back support to help maintain posture, even when sitting for long periods of time. The dual cushions can be adjusted to support both the lumbar and cervical spines simultaneously, allowing gamers to settle back into the chair with ease. With a lockable synchronic-tilt mechanism and special Z-Shape design, the chairs can take heavier weight than normal mechanisms, allowing users to recline up to an angle of 160 degrees and then lock when not in rocking mode.</p>

<p>The Anda Seat Marvel gaming chairs AD memory pillows enable users to experience a luxurious sitting experience. Sensitive to pressure and temperature, the memory pillows mould to the shape of the body, ensuring the ideal sitting posture. The backrest is entirely independent and adjustable, which also lessens the strain on the neck and back. The 4D PU covered customize armrests on all of the chairs also allow for a wide variety, in terms of width and height adjustments to better support the wrists and arms, with the ability to move front and back, up and down, left/right and pan.</p>
