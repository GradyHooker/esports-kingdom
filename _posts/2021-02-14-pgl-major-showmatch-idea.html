<p>It is November 2013, over 7 years ago, and the first ever Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Major is coming to a thrilling conclusion. The Elmia in Jönköping is getting it's roof blown off by two local teams tearing it up in the grand finals.</p>

<p>DreamHack Winter 2013 was the first Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Major and saw 16 teams face off in a Bo1 GSL Group and then Bo3 Single-Elimination Bracket. It was hosted in Jönköping, Sweden and there was four local teams at the time; Ninjas in Pyjamas, SK Gaming, LGB eSports, and Fnatic. Three of those teams were able to make it past the Group Stage, but we are going to talk about the final two teams that made it all the way to the Grand Finals. That being Fnatic and the Ninjas in Pyjamas.</p>

<p>In our opinion the stars are aligning to potentially have a really great showmatch.</p>

<p class="subheading">The Location</p>
<p>Recently <a href="/counter-strike/2021-01-csgo-majors-are-back">PGL announced that the next CSGO Major would be hosted in Stockholm, Sweden in October and November of this year</a>. Even though it isn't hosted in Jönköping, you are still going to have a white-hot Swedish crowd (safety conditions permitting) going crazy for the first Major in a long time.</p>

<p class="subheading">GeT_RiGhT</p>
<p>In January, GeT_RiGhT announced his retirement from CSGO leaving the Dignitas squad that had featured many of his former teammates to move into a permanent streamer role. He never got his send-off match after an emotional showing at ESL One Cologne 2019. This would be one final match in his home-country with no pressure - a true retirement.</p>
