<p>"Turf War" - There isn't a huge theme this week, instead you will be playing some Wingman with your friends while trying to get some kills either scoped, with the enemies weapons, or from very specific locations on the map.</p>

<p>Broken Fang Week 14 Challenges:</p>

<li><span style="font-weight: bold">Expanding Influence </span>: Win rounds in Wingman: Guard (4 rounds, 8 rounds, 12 rounds)</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold">Hornet's Nest</span> (2 stars): Get 20 kills with enemy weapons in Guardian: Mirage</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold">Deadlock</span>: Get kills from specific locations in Deathmatch: Dust II (15 kills, 20 kills, 40 kills)</li>
<li><span style="font-weight: bold">Territorial Dispute</span>: Get scoped kills in Casual: Defusal Group Sigma (5 kills, 10 kills, 15 kills)</li>
