<p>Yesterday it was announced that after 5 years at the top of the game the Astralis core would be shattered as device would be heading over to Ninjas in Pyjamas. This left the CSGO world ratted, but none more than his teammates who all commented on his exit.</p>

<p>Together this Astralis core of Xyp9x, dupreeh, gla1ve, and device captured 3 major championships, two of which were back-to-back with StarLadder Berlin Major 2019 and Intel Extreme Masters Katowice Major 2019.</p>

<p>Recently their performance had been less than stellar with a 5th-6th place at ESL Pro League Season 13 and IEM Katowice and a 9th-16th bottom place at BLAST Premier Spring Showdown after a loss to OG.</p>

<p>As a unit this team spent an entire year from May 2018 to May 2019 at the top of the mountain, proving day in and day out that they are the undisputed Kings of Counter-Strike.</p>

<p>In July 2020 Astralis are the first team to properly try out the 6-man roster concept as they begin to sign upcoming Danish talent like es3tag, Snappi, JUGi, and Bubzkji. This allowed players like device to take a break from the active line-up.</p>

<p>As much as we talk about the four-player core of Astralis, their coach zonic has been around for just as long and is just as important to the success of this core.</p>
