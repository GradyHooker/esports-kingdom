	</div>

<p class="interview-question">Grady: First off, Chiefs, New Zealand player in an Auzzie squad. How's that?</p>
<p>sterling: It's alright, they take me in as one of their own.</p> 

<p class="interview-question">So you're not treated differently?</p>
<p>Not treated differently, no nothing like that.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Recently in New Zealand Counter-Strike, the LetsPlay.Live Alpha Invitational. Is that a big step for New Zealand as a Counter-Strike nation?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think it is a really good step. You've got Grat (<a href="2018-05-gratisfaction-interview">Listen to our Gratisfaction interview here</a>) playing there and ofnu and zewsy were playing there as well. It's a pretty big event, they had some technical issues but it's the first time running the event, and it's at SkyCity which is a good place for a venue for an event. It's really good and hopefully in the future they can do more damage.</p>

<p class="interview-question">I was actually surprised, I'm from New Zealand as well, the SkyTower...who would have thought 6 month ago that the SkyTower would be an esports arena?</p>
<p>Yeah, it's really good. They've got the pracc rooms and everything in there and you get a good view out of it.</p>

<p class="interview-question">The local scene in New Zealand, is there much of a scene?</p>
<p>Not really. We used to have the PingZero LAN, I've only ever attended one, but I don't think they have done that in over a year - last one was a year ago, so it is pretty rough at the moment.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Nowadays if you see a professional New Zealand Counter-Strike player, they are on an Auzzie squad.</p>
<p>Yeah for sure.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Can you talk us through your story of how you came up from New Zealand and ended up here?</p>
<p>About a year and a half ago I started playing, just with some mates, in a CGA team and we slowly grinded up together all the way up to CGP. Then as soon as the season finished I got an offer to replace aliStair who left Chiefs for ORDER. So I replaced him and I've been in the squad for around 3 or 4 months now. I've had some good times, this is my first international event, so thats been pretty good fun.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Coming to IEM Sydney, you get that opportunity to go up against the international teams - unfortunately the game against Fnatic didn't last too long. Is there still something you guys are going to take away from that?</p>
<p>I think that I personally had a good event, getting to play the international players theres not that much of a difference there wasn't that much of a difference like you would perceive form the outside having not played them. So that was enjoyable to get the experience and practice against the teams. I think we definitely could have had a better showing against MVP if we'd had more time to prepare for the event, because we were forced to make a roster change with Grayhound poaching liam (IGN: malta), so we didn't get that much practice time...maybe 2 weeks.</p>

<p class="interview-question">The VAC banned members of your team. Recently a member of the higher ups in the organization tweeting about it as well. How do you feel about it? Do you feel that they should be able to repeal them?</p>
<p>I feel they definitely should be able to have an opportunity to appeal it. When Matt (IGN: Texta) got his VAC ban I think he was 12 or 13 years old, it's just too young to know the difference between right and wrong for such a permanent thing. So it sucks that we wont be able to play in Valve majors for the foreseeable future, which I definitely think Oceanian teams can definitely qualify for with the changes to 22 teams. Yeah, it's a bit unlucky.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Other than yourselves and Renegades, who do you see as the top Australian team?</p>
<p>I think definitely Grayhounds at the moment, they've got really good fundamentals. Coming into this event I knew they would do well, because out of all the teams like us, ORDER, TM, everyone - they've got by far the best fundamentals, they work together as a team, they've got the best roles; Grat is a great AWPer, dexter is a great IGL and you've got erkaSt fragging it's just great.</p>

<p class="interview-question">I've also asked the other New Zealand players, would you happy to play in an all Kiwi lineup?</p>
<p>For sure, it would be great fun. We'd get the triple AWP setup with me, sico and Grat...</p>

<p class="interview-question">...That is pretty much what all the comments were, 'It would be a little tough, we'd all be AWPing at all times"</p>
<p>(laughs) We'd just be like TyLoo when they were running the triple AWP yesterday.</p>

<p class="interview-question">It'd be good fun, but I don't know how well you'd do.</p>
<p>(laughs) Yeah, I don't know how well we'd do.</p>

<p class="interview-question">ESL Pro League now expanding into Asia-Pacific, do you see that as another opportunity for these Australian teams?</p>
<p>Yeah I feel like this year specifically ESL have done a lot for Oceanian teams. We've got Pro League, qualifiers for every IEM event, 3 slots at Sydney this year and we have Legacy as well you replaced Space Soldiers due to visa issues - so there's 5 teams at this event from Oceania. So it's a really great experience for the scene and hopefully we can bring that back for other teams to learn off.</p>

<p class="interview-question">Thanks a lot man.</p>
<p>No problems.</p>
