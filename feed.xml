        <title>DreamHack Masters Marseille Day 2 Summary and Day 3 Predictions</title>
        <description>Day 2 has wrapped up at Le DÃ´me de Marseille, and none of the results were extremely surprising. Also note, I was 4-0 on picks in yesterday's Day 1 summary and Day 2 preview and every team that won their group's second game yesterday won today's match.

Group A
{% include team-info.html logo=&quot;faze&quot; logo2=&quot;cloud9&quot; text=&quot;Game 1 on Overpass was Cloud9's map pick. FaZe took CT side to start, but that did not provide them with the early lead they may have expected. It was all Cloud9 from the start, taking a 9-2 lead. FaZe regrouped and managed to take the last four rounds of the first half to bring it back to 9-6. Unfortunately for FaZe, Cloud9 again took the pistol round. This translated into 5 quick rounds in the second half. Cloud9 only truly looked vulnerable on match point, where they sat for 6 rounds until they closed the match at 16-13. Surprisingly, FaZe took the first kill in 18 of the 29 rounds, but Cloud9 never let that really rattle them. Game MVP goes to autimatic for his 27/4/17 stat line with 100.3 ADR.&quot; extratext=&quot;Game #1 - Overpass&quot; %}

{% include team-info.html logo=&quot;faze&quot; logo2=&quot;cloud9&quot; text=&quot;Game 2 was very similar. Taking place on FaZe's map pick of Mirage, Cloud9 choose T side. FaZe took the pistol round and round 2 before giving up five of the next six. A brief trade of short win streaks ended the first half at 9-6 in favor of Cloud9 once again. In the second half, FaZe took the second pistol round, this time using it to go on a 6 round winning streak to take the least 9-12. C9 responded with a 5 round streak of their own to tip the match in their favor once again 14-12. The last four rounds were a hard fought back and forth, but ultimately C9 closed it out 16-14. This match, despite losing, the MVP belongs to NiKo. He played his heart out, but just couldn't carry the team hard enough with a 33/3/22 stat line and 105.9 ADR that culminated in a 1.52 rating.&quot; extratext=&quot;Game #2 - Mirage&quot; %}

{% include team-info.html logo=&quot;faze&quot; logo2=&quot;cloud9&quot; text=&quot;The most surprising part of this result was Cloud9 taking the match in a straight sweep. I expected a much harder fought, 3 game match where Cloud9 would edge out FaZe for the win. As it stands, the games were close, but Cloud9 played with more consistency. FaZe was far too streaky to win the games.&quot; extratext=&quot;Final Thoughts&quot; %}

{% include team-info.html logo=&quot;envyus&quot; logo2=&quot;faze&quot; pretext=&quot;Going Forward (Day 3)&quot; extratext=&quot;Decider Match&quot; text=&quot;As we saw in the opening match of the tournament, EnVyUs does not have the firepower to match up with FaZe Clan. This one will not be pretty. FaZe Clan in 2.&quot; %}

Group B
{% include team-info.html logo=&quot;mousesports&quot; logo2=&quot;nip&quot; text=&quot;mousesports choose Nuke for the first map and NiP decided to take CT side. mouse took pistol round and jumped out to an early 6-2 lead. NiP did not just roll over though, taking 5 of the next 7 to bring the half to a close at 8-7 mousesports. Things looked like they would continue to turn in NiP's favor when they won the pistol round, but mouse wasn't going to let that happen. In direct counter to what happened in their match against Valiance, mouse took control in the second half by winning 8 of the next 9 rounds, proving me wrong by closing a match out when I said they lacked that ability in yesterday's preview of the match. MVP in this match was a close call, but it goes to SuNny. He had a 25/3/17 line, 100.9 ADE, and a 1.47 rating, however, the reason he gets it is for his 3 triple kills that swung rounds in the favor of mouse and even closed out the game.&quot; extratext=&quot;Game #1 - Nuke&quot; %}

{% include team-info.html logo=&quot;mousesports&quot; logo2=&quot;nip&quot; text=&quot;Overpass was NiP's map pick and mouse decided that they would take CT first. The pistol round went the way of mouse again, but a bomb plant give NiP a good economy despite the round loss, and they took 6 of the next 7 rounds to take the lead, 6-2. oskar was able to take the next round with a 3k in a 3v2 retake, but it didn't matter much as NiP picked up 4 of the final 6 rounds in the half to go into the second half with an 10-5 lead. NiP took the second pistol round and 4 of the next 5 to get to match point at 15-6, however it took them 5 more rounds to close out the game 16-10 and send the match to map 3. Ropz gets the MVP for this map, because without his 25/3/17 line and 1.46 rating, mouse would have lost in much more embarrassing fashion.&quot; extratext=&quot;Game #2 - Overpass&quot; %}

{% include team-info.html logo=&quot;mousesports&quot; logo2=&quot;nip&quot; text=&quot;After all the bans came through, Train was picked as the final map with NiP on T side to start the game. Mouse took the pistol round and 5 of the first 6 to jump out to a 5-1 lead, but NiP came roaring back with 7 of the final 9 in the half, completely dominating mouse over that span. With the score 7-8 in favor of NiP going into the second half, NiP took the pistol round and looked ready to cruise to victory, but mouse took the very next round and two more after to retake the lead 10-9. Unfortunately for mouse, their inability to close out matches came back in devastating fashion, and they lost all but 1 of the next 8 rounds to give NiP an 11-16 win and the match. NiP relied a lot on GeT_RiGhT's multi-frags, including a 4k to end the match like he had to end map 2. This, coupled with his 19/5/16 line and 1.20 rating is enough to name him MVP of the map and the match, as he closed out two maps for NiP.&quot; extratext=&quot;Game #3 - Train&quot; %}

{% include team-info.html logo=&quot;mousesports&quot; logo2=&quot;nip&quot; text=&quot;This went much the way I expected, with mouse ultimately showing why their fans have little faith in them actually closing out wins. NiP played a solid, no nonsense match, and capitalized on every mistake mouse made.&quot; extratext=&quot;Final Thoughts&quot; %}

{% include team-info.html logo=&quot;skgaming&quot; logo2=&quot;mousesports&quot; pretext=&quot;Going Forward (Day 3)&quot; extratext=&quot;Decider Match&quot; text=&quot;Unfortunately for mousesports, it looks like SK found a rhythm yesterday in the elimination match against Valiance. I don't think this will be very close, with SK comfortably winning a 2-0 sweep.&quot; %}

Group C
{% include team-info.html logo=&quot;fnatic&quot; logo2=&quot;navi&quot; text=&quot;The first map was Na'Vi's pick, and they chose Inferno with Fnatic starting on the T side. Na'Vi wasted no time in showing why this was their map pick, sprinting out to a 7-0 lead. Despite this, Fnatic had 3 rounds in that span that a clutch just didn't go their way. They bounced back though by winning the next 3 rounds. The final 5 rounds traded back and forth, and at half the game was 10-5 in favor of Na'Vi. Na'Vi again took the pistol round in the second half, and won the next two rounds to extend their lead to 13-5. Though Fnatic put up a little fight by taking the next two rounds, Na'Vi put a stop to that and ultimately won the map 16-7. The entire team of Na'Vi outperformed Fnatic's top player in KRIMZ, and the MVP was hard to decide for the map. Though s1mple was great, in the end I had to go with Zeus. He had several very vital delays to allow his team to rotate, and a pair of clutches to go with his 21/5/9 stat line and 1.57 rating.&quot; extratext=&quot;Game #1 - Inferno&quot; %}

{% include team-info.html logo=&quot;fnatic&quot; logo2=&quot;navi&quot; text=&quot;Fnatic chose Cobblestone with map 2. Na'Vi took T side, but couldn't take the pistol round. Fnatic and Na'Vi proceeded to trade off 3 round streaks and 2 single rounds to go into round 12 with Fnatic leading 7-4. Na'Vi wasn't going to let this slip away in the first half, and they proceeded to win out the half to lead going into halftime 7-8. Na'Vi, like the first map, took the second half pistol round. Unfortunately for them, Fnatic refused to back down, and took 2 of the next 3 rounds. They ended the match winning 7 of the final 9 rounds to close out the map 16-11 and send the match to a game 3. Though the match score seems semi-close, it was rather one-sided in favor of Fnatic. For this reason, electronic gets the MVP for the round for me. Without his absurd 137.6 ADR and 1.77 rating Na'Vi would have been blown out of Cobble.&quot; extratext=&quot;Game #2 - Cobblestone&quot; %}

{% include team-info.html logo=&quot;fnatic&quot; logo2=&quot;navi&quot; text=&quot;The deciding map ended up on Overpass with Fnatic starting on CT. Unlike the last two games, Fnatic came out strong and put Na'Vi into a 6-0 hole. Na'Vi never faltered though, taking 7 of the next 9 rounds, to end the half down only one round at 8-7. Fnatic took the second pistol round of the game, but Na'Vi reversed the fortunes from the last game by taking the save round. They proceeded to win the next 6 rounds and take a commanding 14-9 lead. Fnatic then flipped the script and won 5 of the next 6 rounds, including 3 match points for Na'Vi to bring up a round 30 match point. Fnatic got the first kill of the final round and a bomb plant, but Na'Vi answered with 4 rapid kills. Na'Vi secured the game and the match with a smoke defuse as GOLDEN attempted to prevent it. The MVP of the game was, without a doubt, s1mple with a 32/5/19 stat line and a 1.56 rating he went off after looking decidedly average in map 2.&quot; extratext=&quot;Game #3 - Overpass&quot; %}

{% include team-info.html logo=&quot;fnatic&quot; logo2=&quot;navi&quot; text=&quot;Fnatic came out and did better than I expected of them. This was the best contest of the day, with both teams never really letting up on the pressure. Both teams took their map picks and the decider was a nail-biting back and forth affair. They both look strong heading into their next matches.&quot; extratext=&quot;Final Thoughts&quot; %}

{% include team-info.html logo=&quot;renegades&quot; logo2=&quot;fnatic&quot; pretext=&quot;Going Forward (Day 3)&quot; extratext=&quot;Decider Match&quot; text=&quot;Renegades does not match up with Fnatic well at all. Fnatic has shown they are undoubtedly better on LAN than online. This will be another 2-0, in favor of Fnatic.&quot; %}

Group D
{% include team-info.html logo=&quot;liquid&quot; logo2=&quot;astralis&quot; text=&quot;Mirage was the map pick for Liquid in game 1with Astralis on T side to start. Astralis won the pistol round and the next 2, but Liquid rebounded in the first gun round to win the next 5 rounds. 8-5 after 13 rounds. Fnatic won the final 2 rounds to end the half 8-7. Astralis again won the pistol round in the second half and the following round, allowing them to retake the lead, 9-8. Liquid proceeded to win 6 of the next 8 rounds to go to match point at 15-10. Astralis did not let Liquid take the map that easily though, sending all the way to the 30th round, but Liquid didn't let the collapse happen. Liquid won a 2v5 final round to win the map 16-14. MVP was not a difficult pick this time as Elige was head and shoulders above everyone else with a 28/ /921 score line and a great 1.56 rating.&quot; extratext=&quot;Game #1 - Mirage&quot; %}

{% include team-info.html logo=&quot;liquid&quot; logo2=&quot;astralis&quot; text=&quot;Map 2 was Astralis' pick, and they choose Overpass. Liquid took CT, but it did not prove to be beneficial, as Astralis showed why this is their map. Astralis made it look easy as they jumped out to a quick 8-0 lead. After Liquid took a round, Astralis reset them, and the rest of the half continued to be nearly all Astralis to take the score 12-3 into half. Astralis took their 4th pistol round of the match, and cruised to an easy 16-3 map victory. MVP easily goes to gla1ve for his 2.12 rating and 24/1/9 line.&quot; extratext=&quot;Game #2 - Overpass&quot; %}

{% include team-info.html logo=&quot;liquid&quot; logo2=&quot;astralis&quot; text=&quot;The decider took place on Cache, with Astralis starting on CT. They took the pistol round and proceeded to dominate the entire match. There was never any doubt in this match, as Astralis only allowed Liquid to win 4 rounds in a 16-3 stomp. MVP goes to device with an impressive 129.5 ADR, 23/3/5 stat line and a 2.19 rating with a 1v4 clutch to win the match.&quot; extratext=&quot;Game #3 - Cache&quot; %}

{% include team-info.html logo=&quot;liquid&quot; logo2=&quot;astralis&quot; text=&quot;After the first game, Astralis easily handled Liquid. Liquid did not win a single pistol round and that was a big part of their loss, as they just could not get anything going. This was a less a case of Liquid playing bad, and Astralis playing really well.&quot; extratext=&quot;Final Thoughts&quot; %}

{% include team-info.html logo=&quot;gambit&quot; logo2=&quot;liquid&quot; pretext=&quot;Going Forward (Day 3)&quot; extratext=&quot;Decider Match&quot; text=&quot;Liquid handled Gambit easily in their first game, and I don't expect that to go differently this time. Gambit is in bad form, Liquid is not, despite the lopsided losses to Astralis. 2-0 sweep goes in Liquid's favor.&quot; %}
